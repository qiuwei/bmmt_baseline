the former fight of all the MEP from Greece and many of their comrades-in-arms has ultimately led to success . 
our Mr Désir and rapporteur , Mr Poos , has a significant contribution . 
in my opinion , it is encouraging that , ultimately , this has been taken , the unpraktikablen amerikanisch-britischen plan . 
now , it is of the free Republic of Cyprus as a member of the European Union the opportunity , with the Besatzermacht , Turkey and its local representative , Mr Denktash , a fair political solution to the Zypern-Frage , broker a solution to the the overwhelming majority of the Turkish Cypriots , together with the Greek Cypriots sehnlichst hopes . 

the Republic of Cyprus is a completely confused legal situation , because the north of the island by Turkey is illegally occupied . 
this occupation is in the rest of the United Nations , as well as has been condemned by the European Union . 

I am still of the opinion that it was necessary , for the accession , because the Cypriots to vote in favour by a no twice punished would be : they are already occupied by the Turks and we would then be rejected by the Union . 
in fact , would have with Turkey a definitive conclusion must be spoken , because it is the only thing they . 
it would be to clearly understand that they need to give its status as assoziierter partner of the European Union if they do not lose , from the north of the island . 
I regret that we in the past was not the courage to do this , but I hope that this will happen in the future . 


but unfortunately , this is not the way for the Union at the moment , because it is indeed a Schmusekurs still sails by the prospect of Turkey still maintaining financial aid to double , and this also as aid to Beitrittsvorbereitung einstuft . 
under these circumstances , we demand that before - I repeat , the opening of possible accession negotiations with Turkey referenda in all the countries of Europe will be carried out . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen . 
the Council has , in spite of the warnings and the Commission &apos; s Vorhaltungen during the negotiations - insisted on to make a clear Rechtsbruch . 
with the controversial maintenance of Annex XV in the accession treaty and the totally unilateral change to the financial framework of the Council has 2004-2006 the interinstitutional agreement ( IIV ) between Parliament and the Council of 6 May 1999 broken . 
so that he has the Budgetrechte of Parliament are being trampled underfoot . 
at the same time , it requires the European Parliament on an alternative either for his rights or to fight to vote in favour of the Accession Treaties . 
with such a behaviour has the Council has been disrupted acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries must make this point of view of the ELDR Group , their preparations have actually been completed and must be examined individually each country . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , according to which the border of Cyprus , which will shortly an external borders of the Union and , therefore , the Netherlands , will be sufficiently is safe . 
in addition , we are confident that on the EU to find a solution to the Cyprus conflict . 
if we are in the vote on the inclusion of Cyprus have not contain , then the Cypriot people , because we have to be ashamed of anything at all . 
no , we throw the leaders of the European Union , their Unverantwortlichkeit . 
if we than a divided country , whose existenzielles problem is resolved , in the European Union , although with regret , then this is an ( further ) signs for the inability of the Union as such , genuine political will to demonstrate . 
the inclusion of Cyprus into the Union , of course , would have to be dependent on its reunification . 
however , rather than this condition and to ask the question of the accession of Cyprus to use as a lever , the European Union has , to regret the fact that they themselves a divided country . 
we think dare to dream great dreams ! 

this umpteenth wasted opportunity will not have that a of a foreign power besetztes country will be included in the Union , that Turkey an additional and permanent means of blackmail with regard to the European Union in the will and the external borders of the Union de facto to the green line will set a limit - which neither of the Union or otherwise irgendjemandem apart from Turkey to be recognised . 


Mr President , this chapter 5 years was the our guiding principle of the Union : deepening before enlargement . 
the Heads of State and Government repeated in learned way that the structures and the decision-making process of the Union before the enlargement on 25 and more members must be reformed . 
this should be done with the Treaty of Nice . 
but nothing has been dealt with this Treaty , but the decision-making process in the Council more complicated . 
therefore , showed the need for the convening of a European convention , to a new Gründungsvertrag , to a European constitution . 
with the signing ceremony of the accession treaties on 16 April 2003 is enlargement before the end of the work of the convention . 
it is a enlargement in the institutional foggy weather , all the more since the Irakkrise the süßen ideals , in the context of a common foreign and security policy has had been made . 
Mr President , I voted for the inclusion of the Republic of Latvia in the European Union votes . 
as a single representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party Italy in this House , I hope and the wish that the Letten in the next European Parliament , which also about the Republic of Latvia is enlarged , including a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party may choose , together with the other - as I very much hope many - Representative of the Rentnerparteien of all the Member States in 2004 , for the first time in the European Parliament will be able to help the interests of the elderly to defend and citizens . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen .

with such a behaviour has the Council has been disrupted acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries must make this point of view of the ELDR Group , their preparations have actually been completed and must be examined individually each country . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria there were no doubt that the from the European Parliament have been on many occasions . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , which states that even the countries in which he has found the majority of deficits , including Latvia , at the time of their accession will be sufficient to meet the Copenhagen criteria . 
the warnings of Commissioner Verheugen to some candidate countries , the decision of the Commission , six months before the accession of a Comprehensive to publish Report monitoring by the ELDR Group proposed peer group review of the new and old Member States in the field of human rights , corruption , Verwaltungskapazität and independent financial control ( Amendment No Malmström / Maaten ) , the for the Commission , the possibility of a few years direct measures against the internal market , to take ( the Garantieklauseln ) , and the own-initiative report , Mr Mulder , on the reform of the approval of the expenditure are therefore of crucial importance . 
Mr President , this now Chapter 6 I am not one to those who Poland and other countries , that they want to abstrafen in favour of the Atlantic solidarity of the European solidarity have brought forward . 
every state , each government has the right to support the Kriegspolitik Bush or not . 
but it is clear that the majority of the new members of the Union a US alliance and the NATO a broader European integration . 
the representatives of the British government in the convention their delight over this development . 
in an interview with The Times was Peter Hain clearly that it is , in an alliance with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe against any shift towards a European superstate . 
the United Kingdom and others will therefore not hesitate to the Intergovernmental Conference , what the results of the convention to confirm to make use of their right of veto . 
this veto could , in any intention to qualified majority decision-making procedures in areas such as the common foreign and security policy , the budgetary and fiscal policy , the economic and social policy . 
the use of the word &apos; federal &apos; will be verfehmt . 
an appeal to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in judicial decisions for individuals will not be possible . 
Mr President , today , on 9 April 2003 , I voted for the inclusion in Lithuania voted in favour of the European Union . 
I also hope to the inclusion of a representative of the Lithuanian Pensioners &apos; Party in the European Parliament to support in the defence of the rights of all the elderly throughout Europe .

Mr President , I shall now turn to my last chapter . 
in view of the institutional Nebels that I have just have denounced the enlarged European Union will be forced to confine myself to a single market . 
it is therefore in actual fact , to a Freihandelsassoziation , as far as possible , still on the other side of the Atlantic . 
it is interesting that the most supporter of this rash enlargement from the ranks of the former EFTA-Mitglieder . 
since I do not want the enlarged European Union a of Washington abgesegneten huge market of the rich countries , remains for me , as is nothing more than before reluctantly consenting to decide me when it comes to the vote on the accession of all the new Member States abstained on the but nonetheless , I warmly welcome to him . 

Mr President , I voted for Hungary &apos; s accession to the European Union . 
since , in the enlarged Europe at least 200 million pensioners will live , I hope that the withdrawal of Hungary with their own representatives in the European Parliament , it will allow us to make a proper balance between the number of Members and the number of pensioners in Europe . 
I therefore hope that the Hungarian pensioners in this Parliament to send a representative , so that the interests of the elderly throughout Europe more effectively and with more force may be defended .

Mr President , today , on 9 April 2003 , I have listened with great enthusiasm for the accession and the inclusion of Malta in the European Union in the hope that , also by Malta a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the next European Parliament will be elected , so that we all together , together with the other representatives of the Rentnerparteien of all the other candidate countries , the interests of the elderly citizens of Europe as a whole can defend more effectively .

. 
I voted today against the request of the Republic of Malta for inclusion in the European Union . 
reason for my decision is the attachment of Malta to the Zugvogeljagd . 
Malta had in the accession negotiations strictly refused , the during the European Union ( EU-Vogelschutzrichtline ) in full , and has achieved a transitional period that has been established , the Malta the Vogeljagd until the end of 2008 . 
this regulation is a blank cheque for Wilderer and illegal those who sell them . 
hunt for High Sea , Singvogeljagd with Schlagnetzen and the mass Abschuss seltenster Singvögel are , after European Rechtsvorstellungen strictly prohibited . 
a Beitrittsbewerber must recognise this legal basis . 
Mr President ! 
it was a difficult decision , against the accession of a country to vote in favour , for which I have a very great deal of respect for these serious Gewissensentscheidung . I have taken for me alone . 
I have neither my group is trying to influence , I have yet to be swayed by them . 
I can add my voice to be not a candidate country actively with kämpfenden troops in a illegal , unmoralischen and dirty war in Iraq , by making Völkerrechtsbruch without any hesitation , and the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians supports . 
Poland is on the wrong way and his government , but not only . 
the Polish people have preferred to see the American Kriegsminister instead to follow the Polish Pope . 
the Poland are greater on their Spezialeinheit GROM than on their Catholic Bischöfe , which is fight for peace . 
they conclude by themselves from the community of values in the EU . 
I hope that you will soon come back . 
today , after careful thought , and in complete agreement with my conscience , I have voted in favour of &apos; no &apos; . 
Mr President , I hope that , also from Poland - which I voted for accession - a representative or a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the next European Parliament and in this House will have the support , so that I more force for our common defence policy will be all the elderly throughout Europe . 
there are two reasons for my symbolic vote against the accession of Poland . 
the first reason is that in the so-called &apos; ethical declaration &apos; , which has been added to the accession Treaties and which covers the position against abortion situation and . 
the second reason is the involvement of Polish soldiers on Irak-Krieg , in a demonstration servilen Pro-Amerikanismus and a very vermessenen anti-European attitude . 
I think that I therefore for the hopes and wishes of the proud Polish people favour , that as an independent country and a member of the European Union to conclude a period in which this great , historic country has been used as a satellite , for the time of the United States and before from Russia and Germany . 
we support the right of Poland , as well as all the other candidate countries to join the European Union . 
but this country has saddled conditions are clearly show that the accession treaty . 
Poland has , for example , is not entitled to the same agricultural subsidies such as the countries of the current European Union , although the farmers a large part of its population . 
but the European institutions to subsidise their capitalist agriculture , so that they abwirft profits , as the poor farmers to help of the countries of their work to be able to live . 
furthermore , the Polish workers , despite all the legal Kopfstände seven years to wait before they come and work in the Union . 
it is also unacceptable that this Union , which is so demanding , if the working classes of this country should be sacrifices , the Polish Church readily concessions . 
the European Union , not only accepts the freedom of women beeinträchtigende Abtreibungsverbot , but does ahead of all , that the relevant Polish legislation can be changed by Community law , and can be so that the Polish women in the cold , which are under the thumb of a particularly reactionary Church !

with such a behaviour has the Council has been disrupted acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
. 
I will justify my &apos; no &apos; to the accession of the Republic of Poland , at the moment , to the European Union , so that Poland was the only one candidate country actively with Elitesoldaten in a völkerrechtswidrigen war , which is taking place in Iraq , at the moment . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries must make this point of view of the ELDR Group , their preparations have actually been completed and must be examined individually each country .

Mr President , bearing in mind that , in Slovenia already a Pensioners &apos; Party , on behalf of the DeSUS - which , in the government of the country is involved , I hope that your wish . I hope that it is a own representatives in this Parliament can send , so that the pensioners not only Slovenia , but all the countries of the new , from the EP-Wahlen produced in 2004 Europe on a massive presence of supporters of the interests of older people can support from the Rentnerparteien all of these countries , including Slovenia , sources .

- ( NL ) As a member of the Delegation for relations with the Slovakia , I know about the problems of this country &apos; s response in more detail than on the other candidate countries . 
I note that , and therefore political parties that the economy , with the result is largely collapsed massive unemployment in the East and that the successive governments are not prepared to the relatives of national minorities sooner angetanes or injustice . 
the re-division in provinces completely neglected the fact that , on the southern edge of Slovakia ungarisch discussed and of the vast majority of the local population , would like to that ungarisch administration and education . 
the majority of members of the Roma-Bevölkerungsgruppe occupied villages in the East is still managed by a Slovak elite , the a Alleinanspruch on Straßenbeleuchtungen , to have Wasserwerke and gardens . 
many people may from of Slovakia for , in the neighbouring Vienna to seek work . 
with the inclusion of Slovakia , the EU imported the environmental problems of the nuclear power stations and of the Donau-Staudamms . 
the accession is , however , in the internally divided Slovakia far less controversial than in the neighbouring countries of Poland and the Czech Republic , in which the majority will soon be included in the context of a referendum possibly will vote against it . 
various groups who would like to see this accession improvements . 
on 5 September 2001 , I have expressed the fear that it will be disappointed , however , I respect your decision . 

once again is the vote on the calendar of part-sessions of the European Parliament for 2004 of the Straßburg-Gegnern had been mislead , in order to reduce Anwesenheitszeit in this city . 
and as the last few times this vote is contrary to the Treaty , because of the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions has been established , that 12 sittings in Strasbourg . 
a reduction on 11 meetings in Wahljahren traditionellerweise is permitted . 
but this time , the anti-Strasbourg are actually went even further , they will only 10 meetings . 
this result is and others , indeed , one of the absurd machinations of the Party of European Socialists , due to remove the last April , so as not to have to work on 1 May . 
the contradiction is still blatant , if you are saying that the calendar of part-sessions adopted for 2004 the implementation of 5 Minitagungen in Brussels , which can be accepted only in theory , if the 12 normal plenary part-session in Strasbourg are not enough . 
we call on the French Government , the Court of Justice oppose this illegal vote , because the European Parliament is not a sovereign representatives of the people , but has only on the him with the Treaty and has special powers of the Treaty . 


in view of the special importance of 1 May as Internationaler day of the workers for us it is not in question , in this day in the European Parliament to appear . 
the rest of the timetable not affects us further , and we have no special position on this . 
in accordance with their political line , and the UEN Group is opposed this year each manoeuvres , with the the long run , or the number of the plenary part-session in Strasbourg is to be reduced . 
during the last few years time and again various lobby groups have tried , through a variety of activities of the final transfer of the headquarters of the Parliament of Strasbourg to Brussels - I am thinking particularly of the shortening of the plenary part-session to four days or the increase in the extraordinary meetings in Brussels - penetrates into the UEN Group , on compliance with the Treaties after spirit and letter in which the implementation of 12 meetings per year in Strasbourg . 


it is true that it is customary in Wahljahren , a part-session in Strasbourg on Fridays , but with surprise at the same time , we must say that the number of extraordinary meetings remains unchanged . 
this situation is completely anormal for 2004 , which is why I have proposed two additional meetings , in order to remove the zwölfte in accordance with the legislation again Strasbourg part-session . 
it is obvious that so that everyone must its responsibility . 
for us things are clear : for Strasbourg must not to the rank of a simple Außenstelle of Brussels be herabgestuft ; it is and must remain the headquarters of the European Parliament . 
with its vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2004 to our House has only ten part-sessions in Strasbourg . 
in the Treaties and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is , however , make it clear that the calendar of part-sessions of the European Parliament &apos; s twelve or annually in Wahljahren eleven plenary part-session in Strasbourg , before must have the inclusion of additional Minisitzungen in Brussels can be considered . 

therefore , is missing in the for the election year 2004 calendar of part-sessions adopted a Strasbourg part-session , not to mention the absurdity of the vote on the day that the European Parliament agrees with the accession Treaties of the new Member States , the Strasbourg part-session , on the original deletion of the Members of this States should be welcomed . 
in view of the fact that the result of the European Parliament is illegal , asked the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group , President Pat Cox urgently , to draw the relevant conclusions and the vote altogether . 
it calls for the urgent convening of the Conference of Presidents as quickly as possible , in order to a new , with the law konforme vote to be added . 
. ( DA ) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report , because we believe that it is necessary to guarantee a fair treatment of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the country . 
however , we are in principle the opinion that these rights are the best way of the national legislation of the Member States to be regulated , although they are from one another , but a democratic legitimacy . 
we are also aware that the proposal for a field is concerned , the Title IV of the Treaty Establishing and does not apply to Denmark , cf. the protocol on the position of Denmark . 

in spite of the votes against the MPF-Abgeordneten and also of a large section of the rights of the European Parliament has just adopted Cerdeira Morterero , the report of the directive proposed by the Commission on the family reunification and many erweiternde proposes changes . 
with these amendments , in particular , the definition of the families of the family reunification , which can be used , extended the possibility of this right from the applicant be speeded up and the Ablehnungsmöglichkeiten for the Member States reduced . 
from our point of view , the original Commission proposal was already very bad , both his principle and in his procedures . 
the result of this vote should opening the eyes of the Council . 
even if it does not , is committed to the amendments of the European Parliament to be taken into account ( because this will in this issue simply being consulted ) , the Council should be clear that the principle of a system of family reunification accepted at European level , he puts in place a dangerous mechanism . 
it is obvious that the Commission and its allies in future with their ordinary thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism and its lack of wirklichem sense of the European interests constantly to the constant enlargement will apply pressure to this so-called law . 
we are , of course , against the Polygamie and the repression of these for women . 
however , we do not accept that under the pretext that one of the wives already living in the host , the other entry and residence of be denied . 
under the pretext of moral principles is merely a question of another obstacle to the immigration and personal links . 
although we reject such a limit in principle , we have voted for the amendment , the exemptions at least in the case , if the Kindeswohl this requires . 

furthermore , the amendments we have rejected with demütigendem nature , such as the use of DNA-Tests against the immigrants or the argument of public health , which is based on the selfish attitude , medical aid , the European countries , to refuse people can provide , which would otherwise have no access to this end . 
once again , the proposals , the clear progress , which are not binding , and the report does not help as a whole , the national legislation upwards , but downwards each other . 
. ( DA ) We have chosen to it , our group to do the same and for the motion for a resolution in the report to vote in favour of Morterero . 
but we are aware that the resolution circumstances , which are subject to Title IV of the EC Treaty and does not apply to Denmark whole apply the protocol on the position of Denmark . 
. ( PT ) We are all aware of the gulf between the the Tampere Summit statements and the content of this proposal for a directive , aware of the us now , after more than three-year advice in the Council and two amendments to the original proposal of the Commission , is now before us . 
it was stated that a policy of integration should be aimed at granting rights and duties of immigrants , which are comparable with those of the European citizens . 
this text is in the opposite direction . 
as a result of differences of opinion in the Council is in line with this proposal Community standards , the &apos; bottom-up &apos; on the lowest common denominator have been complied with , with a reduzierenden exposition of the concept of &apos; relatives &apos; , and a great many derogations , so that a number of key points remain unresolved . 
that is why we support the proposals in this report , the the concept of &apos; members &apos; wishes , the principle of non-discrimination and prevent the waiver günstigerer legislation . 
on our initiative , the report now provisions , the examination of applications , not the administrations , in addition to impose their normal workload and the subjective concept of a long-term relationship . 
in addition , it should be banned the incidence of diseases or disabilities according to the issue of the residential status as a justification for the denial of an extension of the residential status . 
with the introduction of these amendments contrasts quality of the report by the original proposal and therefore deserves our support . 
I would like to my colleague , as I have a member of the intergroup &apos; anti-racism &apos; is , for her work on the important and difficult issue of family reunification . 
I voted in favour of this report and I support it in the light of my previous work in the field of immigration , in which I am , in particular , with secondary migration issues . these include , amongst other things , for the provisions in the United Kingdom , after which Ehepaare of different nationalities must prove that the main purpose of the Eheschließung is not the immigration . 
it is important that the Member States of the entry of close relatives as parents and Ehe- or Lebenspartnern , if this does not allow for their own living can provide . 
the implementation of the directive must not lead to the currently granted by the various Member States will be reduced level of protection . 
. 
( PT ) The immigration is a serious problem , the a realistic and responsible reaction from the Community institutions . 
if no appropriate and balanced measures be taken in this area , then it is precisely the harmful effects , which are aware of all European citizens . 
the least during these serious and is now widely recognised problems must be done , it is not to further deteriorate . 
as Commissioner António Vitorino said quite clearly , should be noted that the absorption capacity of the European cities borders . 
we can certainly not the problem of immigration , solve that it is the right to family reunification . 
that is quite clear to me , because I do not deny the importance of this approach . 
but we can and must the right to family reunification only serious , without its raison d &apos; être . 
in the report and in the resolution on this directive has been a different approach in which this right irrationally subsidised on personal circumstances which has been extended to include no family relations . 
this linksgerichtete irresponsibility of serves only to the resistance against distrust and a natural fundamental right to be strengthened . 
for all these reasons , I have to me , to vote against the report . 
that concludes voting time our . 
( the sitting was suspended at 14.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. ) 
the next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0111 / 2003 ) by Mr Morillon , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur - priorities and weaknesses . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as we six months ago in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , our Parliament with the work on this report , we began ahnten not that it is in such a tragic and distressing time would be submitted . 
the aim was at the time the updating of the previous report by our colleague Mrs Catherine Lalumière , who had become necessary , because the events of September 2001 we should be taken into account and a contribution to the work of our fellow Members wanted to make by the convention . 
a as well as though European security and Verteidigungsstruktur at a time to assess want to be feared because , after all , it is at least temporarily completely to breach the system , as it may seem . 
my fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , as they were disagree on 25 March this year , in other words , in the middle of the crisis , the report , which was adopted tomorrow to vote in plenary . 
there are , in my view , at least three reasons . 
firstly , we have a responsibility towards our electorate . 
the second is in the knowledge that the current crisis us on the eve of enlargement must serve as a lesson . 
the third reason , finally , in our intention is a clarification of the policy of the transatlantic cooperation , it appears that the Member States want to continue , with many of us are the hope that the current differences seem more serious than they are . 
the first reason , the responsibility towards our electorate . 
for all of us Eurobarometerumfragen known for years , it is clear that a majority of over two thirds of the European citizens in favour of a common security and defence policy . 
as our colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs are aware of this mood , it was only natural that they should be in a similar percentage share . 
this was the case at least in the vote in committee , which took place for a full debate in the it comes to almost 200 amendments . 
in our new Rules of Procedure , would be a simple vote in Parliament have been possible , but in view of the importance of this issue we were unanimous agreement of the opinion that the current debate is justified , in which we are also the Council and the Commission wanted to . 
in this debate , we identified great value , in order - and this is my second point - without further delay learn the lessons of the current crisis . 
Europe was not in the situation , the United Nations Security Council to speak with one voice , such as this according to the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty would have been his duty . 
this is not proof , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that it is now time for the our institutions , in order to change the confusion in the future and to prevent the Kakophonie , who are beginning to - but , as I hope only temporarily - in the coexistence of the Member States have made a ? 
as you know , the citizens expect , as I have already said , but perhaps more nor the whole world , that Europe its place in the construction of a multipolar political world , in order to prevent the fate of our planet only continue to be borne by the President of the United States . 
I now come to my third and most important point . 
Europe is prepared to take the responsibility for what we expect from him ? 
I am not sure . 
the decision , before the it is today , is in any case clearer than ever before . 
either the Member States , such as in the cold war continue to their defence alone the forces of the United States . 
in this case the Americans they can hardly lessons in how Washington intends to these armed forces . 
or but they accept what the United States have always of them have requested , i.e. to share the burden , which is , of course , a greater contribution to the combined efforts of enterprise . 
NATO Secretary-General , Lord Robertson recently referred in your presence , Commissioner Patten , on the gulf between the governments of Europe declared ambition and the resources , which they are prepared for their implementation . 
he described this as the gap of ambition . 
I hope that the current crisis to help them to make this gulf aware and they lead to start with their eradication . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament , the recent crisis in Iraq has made quite clear , where Europe is lagging behind in what , in particular , for the area of foreign policy and the defence . 
let us not , however , in the weaknesses of Europe have finally adopted . 
this crisis can also be a creative effect on the European policies , and that is why I believe that the report Morillon very timely , even if this is being his drafting was still do not show . 
in today &apos; s time , we must , as the old system of the existence of two superpowers has collapsed , new security policy strategies and measures . 
in view of this fact , the dissemination of weapons of mass destruction is not the only Krisenherd . 
this is not the only risk , through the the global security and stability are being threatened . 
grassierende poverty , organised crime , institutionalised violence and serious economic crises are equally damaging to the global stability and safety as military or terrorist activities . 
of course we have to look at the same time , to what extent and at what stage we in the light of these dangers , to develop the right political measures . 
in addition to all of us elected response , we believe that it is absolutely essential that the global security on mutual trust , cooperation and the consensus in international organisations , pushing and networks is based . 
the method which we deal with threats to global security , will govern our future , if we are building peace and a healthy economic environment ensure and convincing answers to global political , economic and even ecological problems . 
I would like to take the opportunity , also with a view to the Irak-Krise , I am delighted that the extremely interesting report by General Morillon the Presidency has given the opportunity of the views of the Council to a for the European integration subject as important as the European security and defence policy , is to say . 
both the report , Mr Morillon , as well as other relevant initiatives , as the report , Mr Barnier , have offered us valuable ideas , particularly in the for the Intergovernmental Conference planned debate , but also at the present time , can be of use , since the competent authorities of the Council &apos; s draft documents which the integration of the ESVP-Mechanismus . this applies also , of course , for the convention . 
I should like to point out here , and I declare the same why that some of the report Morillon expressed ideas initiatives , which are already on the way and have been brought by the competent bodies of the Union . 
I will in the debate with the current threats to safety , the stability and peace , to start by different than the from the past threats are all familiar . 
the ESVP-Mechanismus was , in order to tell the truth , not from the outset , aimed at horizontal and irrational threats , such as the terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , why the mechanism to tackle them , to be cautious and gradually to the current security environment must be adapted . 
consequently , were the first steps to establish concrete objectives : the use of the forces of the Union for the protection against terrorist attacks on the civilian population , on the one hand , and their use in war zones on the other . 
are there is no doubt that the development and the improvement of the military capabilities of the cornerstone of safety , and therefore also of the defence of the Union . 
we devote special attention to this subject matter , and in the context of the continuation of the so far , efforts is planned , a conference on the skills in order to convene in implementing the appropriate action plan , the ECAP , to assess the progress made and to note and in order to decide what should be moved forward . 
the presidency has drafted a text , the guidelines , which contains after the completion of the work of the relevant working groups , the ECAP-Panels , need to do . 
we hope that these initiatives , a new impulse our operational skills in the military sector and in addition , to improve to help the foundations for the further development of ESDP . 
in this respect , it is of particular importance to the rapid reaction force , which is why this issue has been mentioned by the Spanish Presidency in the priorities in the field of the military aspect of the ESDP has been included . 
the operational framework of the establishment and action of the rapid reaction force will be determined by the competent political and military authorities , were reviewed , and we do , in order to any effort until the end of the Greek presidency to complete . 
it goes without saying that the strengthening of the military capabilities of the Union only then will it be possible if we and our cooperation in the Rüstungsbereich . 
this project should have been planned , of course , already before , but now is the time to implement it , and the European Union sets foot in broken here . 
the decision of the European Council is composed of two parts : firstly , the Council , the role of the Verteidigungsforschung and the development of the relevant capabilities of the Union in a more general framework to be monitored and , secondly , the possibility of setting up of a European Rüstungsagentur , an intergovernmental European authority to investigate . 
these two projects are important steps towards strengthening cooperation in the defence sector . 
the Verteidigungsforschung can , the expectation is that , with the policies of the European Union in terms of competitiveness , in order to be linked with appropriate evidence many sectors and whose development forward as well as greater enlargement . 
with the same intention is also the development of a comprehensive Weltraumpolitik of the Union , which is to be implemented in the Sicherheitssektor , which also in the report Morillon has been raised . 
the developments in the last decade have makes it clear that there are many joint risks and we need a coordinated joint response . 
for this reason , it is necessary to have a common information system security policy and to promote , and , therefore , the creation of a system of common political and military training for crisis management for the Presidency is of interest , and we have been working . 
the report Morillon mentioned idea of a civil peace corps , is a very good idea , especially as this , the European average citizen will help to make aware of what is happening in the Sicherheitssektor and how we deal on practical level , and we have to take part in this . 
this idea we looked at carefully , and the presidency will most likely a draft with the relevant guidelines . 
a basic element of European security is no doubt that the European Union &apos; s relationship with NATO . 
the European option in crisis management is in any case , first of all , to the will and the Handlungsbereitschaft of regional and international organisations to call , in other words , the dialogue has priority . 
the recent agreement on cooperation between the European Union and NATO is an important step towards mutual complement and support of the two organisations . 
I would like to take this opportunity to use the reference , in the report by Mr Morillon , will be given to stress that the activities of the two organisations and its members of the principles of the United Nations Charter determined and must be done . 
ladies and gentlemen , as I have already said , these points , both in the report , Mr Morillon , and in the objectives of the Presidency , and that is why we try to it . 
however , there is no doubt that the report covers a wide range of ideas , the very important questions and institutional aspects of the ESDP concern and so that a remarkable contribution to our debate . 
I do not intend to dwell on each of these in the report containing ideas , despite the fact that many of them very interesting . for the implementation of these ideas , institutional reforms , which are currently in the context of the convention and then discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference to be addressed . 
however , I am sure that it as a valuable source of inspiration and consideration will be of benefit . 
we have reached a decisive turning point . 
the Europäsche Union has the courageous companies in the enlargement and must , therefore , with a firm step for an extension of its policies , so that they ensure on the basis of other factors than in the past their route can go . 
the overwhelming majority of Europeans expects this , as Mr Morillon said in his report . 
the time actually require Entschlussfähigkeit and Handlungswillen , the aim is , at the end of the defence identity of the European Union . 
this will allow the European Union to strengthen their safety and to step up its foreign policy . 
ladies and gentlemen , the current situation could , in spite of the dark side , the start of a intensive discussion of what the European Union , from now on will do , in particular , as we are now in the middle of an open debate on the future of Europe . 
these questions are still not clear , and what lessons we also from the reasons , and the development of the Irak-Krise , we must draw scenario , so that we in the future and prefer to avoid similar situation and Europe in the global system can give greater weight . 
Mr President , I would like to start by General Morillon very warmly on his comprehensive - and in any case highly topical - contribution to the debate on the development of the European security and defence policy . 
on the topical have both my and honourable friend as the Minister of the Council Presidency rightly pointed out . 
the number of amendments , with which the Committee before the adoption of this resolution , has done is of great interest in many respects , frankly but also the different views on this Schlüsselbereichs of European policy . 
in my today &apos; s response I have given me the current competences of the Commission in security and defence issues . 
I will certainly take account of them , and I do not do this , then I will remind Mr Van Orden to them . 
irrespective of what future recommendations of the convention , formulated in the my colleague , Commissioner Barnier the talks on defence issues informed has done - and I know that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , in the course of the discussions on this report has informed - the competences of the Commission is currently in relation to the large number of issues dealt with in this text very limited . 
the Commission is not to the purely military aspects of the European security and defence policy . 
this is only the Member States . 
this is why I shall not comment on the specific military proposals , such as the setting up constantly einsatzbereiter forces , the inclusion of a clause to the collective defence or the creation of a common Militärakademie . 
in the Treaty will the Commission , however , in connection with the ESDP - Article 27 contains a clear reference - and we are actively involved in all the discussions on operations of crisis management in the context of the ESDP , particularly in terms of the instruments for civil conflict management is concerned , policing , for example , strengthening the rule of law and civil administration and civil protection . 
in this context , I am pleased to say that the resolution we have before us sends out the importance of civil and military contributions to crisis management . 
however , it is not possible - and this point , I have on several occasions in this House presented , purely military aspects of the problems that are associated to separate , for which we in the Commission are responsible and to which we have a real contribution to make . 
military and non-military aspects are not clean in different cannot dissociate . 
and they should it , because they have an overall strategy in services closely linked to be coordinated . 
the Commission can , for example , the support of the police forces in the wake of conflicts , such as , for example , in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the European Union on 1 January the police mission has adopted by the UN ; or we could look at the training of Grenzschützern in regions , which uncontrolled Massenmigration will lead to conflicts ; we can also , as in the past and at present in the Balkans in Afghanistan , the reconstruction of administrative structures in countries which have just behind a conflict . 
the Commission has already have a lot of choice of instruments and Fachkenntnissen , which can be used in crisis situations . 
as General Morillon mentioned , which could prove new instruments of the European Union to security as necessary . 
but the most important precondition is that all available instruments in any situation for the implementation agreed political objectives of the European Union should be used . 
I must say that the current events show that this is not the case for a long time . 
another area in which the Commission must take a very important role , relates to the strategy in Rüstungsfragen . 
I believe that we can and should Rüstungshandel and -produktion within the internal market is not a &apos; , closed Jagdgründe &apos; dealt with . 
the procurement of Wehrtechnik , the competition between Rüstungsfirmen , research and development , education , training and imports of Verteidigungsgütern aspects of the Rüstungshandels , talking about dual-use goods and , on a civilian and military benefit at their disposal , these are all areas in which the advantages of the internal market for the European industry are important . 
this is still very can be improved . 
the Commission has recently adopted a communication to the Council and Parliament for Verteidigungsgüterindustrie , adopted in the it refers to a number of areas in which are fundamental progress made possible by the taxpayers in the European Union a greater added value for their in the safety , that money . 
the concerns about a Duplizierung and fragmentation of the production and procurement , of course - and a lack of interoperability of the resolution before us will be raised - some of the key issues to which we in our communication wanted to go . 
our hope is that we have initiated with our on the communication follow-up can help , a strong and competitive defence industry , transparent market conditions and a climate for investment in the for a strengthening of the ESDP necessary research and development projects . 
in the final analysis depends on the credibility of the common foreign and security policy in large part of the military capacity of the European Union . 
the creation of a 60 000 men &apos; strong &apos; rapid reaction force within the framework of the ESDP will certainly to a strengthening of the European credibility abroad . 
it also shows the adoption of the first Militäroperation of the European Union in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last month , in the ESDP that it is not just about a theoretical construction . 
however , I agree with my friend General Morillon entirely that there is still our allies , Europe will be difficult to take seriously , if we do not invest more in our security . 
the argument that Europe is its share of the costs it by a large proportion of the world financed development aid - even if this is , of course , is true - or by the humanitarian aid pursued even further , is not enough . 
we also have a more in the development of our spheres of operation in the form of Lufttransportkapazitäten invest , special teams and Gefechtskommunikationstechnik . 
if we do not do this , then we shall be able to continue to our allies of the opinion that Europe his Friedensdividende after the fall of the Berlin wall has to take place as quickly as possible . 
the main task of aid organisations should still in the provision of aid flows are , at the neutrality , independence and impartiality of such humanitarian operations . 
a respect for these principles is for the satisfaction of humanitarian needs in specimen though is absolutely essential . 
for this reason , the Commission welcomes the fact that the report on the guidelines for the deployment of military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten within the framework of humanitarian UN-Operationen in complex emergencies , the on 20 March 2003 were published by the UN . 
it is clear rules on the relationship between military and humanitarian operators in humanitarian UN-Operationen established . 
the Hauptaussagen of the guidelines should also for the use of European military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten in humanitarian operations . 
I would like to make one last comment about the humanitarian law , the military action to apply . 
we believe that humanitarian law for the conflicts of today &apos; s time is appropriate , provided that the Kriegsparteien and all the signatories of the Geneva Convention is to keep their commitments . 
I should like at this stage to the recognition of the Commission with regard to the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross as subsidiary parties and guardians of the conventions . 
finally , I would like to my honourable friend say once more that this report to almost painful way is topical . 
he raises a number of issues to which direct effect on our credibility in Europe , and if we take the effort in the coming years , a greater contribution in international affairs . but , as I already said on previous occasions in this House said a moment , is in the policy in which we implement its will . 
in relation to security questions this time we have already been long exceeded . 
Mr President , in the wake of Commissioner Patten , I should like to say that the report of Mr Morillon , in fact , it is exactly the right time . 
in the last few weeks us was : the de facto powerlessness of the European Union and the individual Member States , together in the field of defence role to play a notable amendments . 
the criticism of the United States , America should not act as Weltpolizist sounds , in fact , strange from the way of those who do not in themselves in a position to do so and , in fact , often are not prepared . 
we have at the time , in particular , the experiences in Yugoslavia taught us , where the European countries are not from &apos; Friedfertigkeit &apos; and &apos; modesty &apos; they commented publicly , but from &apos; cynicism &apos; and &apos; indifference &apos; . 
this hypocrisy is gradually from this Parliament have disappeared . 
we all have clearly recognised , in my opinion , that Europe responsibility in the defence cultures , and this - in any way whatsoever - has said . 
it is to be hoped that it actually happen . 
only on the organisations of the European Union and in cooperation with the transatlantic partners , it is possible to fulfil this task . 
these two must always be mentioned in a breath . 
they are integrating closely . 
the stronger the transatlantic trust , the greater the internal the unity of the European Union . 
in this area in which the European Union often stirring up trouble i.e. depends dispose with our attitude to the United States , our transatlantic partner , together . 
therefore , the combination of these two a very important element , also in the report by General Morillon . 
it is a realistic path towards a European Verteidigungsverantwortung , and because of its experience as General knows exactly that military actions , always in the first and then buried as they are necessary civil actions . 
in view of the now raubend and plündernd by the roads Bagdads ziehenden Mobs is fully aware of this . 
in addition to a successful concluded must , therefore , I immediately took on civil level . 
the decision on such a cautious , realistic way , for example , to be carried out by joint research and development , through a common definition of the from a European perspective existing military needs . 
this is , of course , always a new departure , and in many countries , it will be difficult for us to move on , but it is of the utmost importance . 
for the production of this is extremely important . 
this is the effectiveness of the Verteidigungsanstrengungen be strengthened considerably . 
if the search for a European point of view of the responsibility which we in the field of defence , our starting point , can also be gained the confidence of all the Member States . 
no one is in order to respond to the question transfer large country , which should be nachgefolgt here now : France , Germany , Great Britain , and the United States . 
it is essential that we in the European Union a common European position in Militärangelegenheiten represented . 
in addition the report by Mr Morillon a unmissverständlicher impulse . 
he acted so that , in fact , an once by Commissioner Patten surgical method , namely the borders of the us by the Treaties already opportunities to capital . 
will this study carried out thoroughly and it is a brick wall at some point , then , to which we know that , as a reform must be and what institutional changes to decide . 
I myself consider that always has for a very practical way , and General Morillon has also decided . 
for a European Verteidigungsverantwortung are the prospects for the moment , of course , still not particularly helpful . 
the developments , which we have seen recently , have shown that the Member States and the members of the Council itself not even have a serious idea of the Council . 
otherwise would imply , for example , the Greek presidency currently initiatives taken in this area in a much greater role to play . 
we must not to the possibility of a Auseinanderfallens of the European Union in two groups , each with a closer cooperation , think . 
in short , it is incredibly important that the European defence at the request of the citizens , as well as General Morillon writes , shape . 
this will allow a more efficient use of the budget , and this is directly to all citizens to success . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , two years after the report , which I had the honour of our House at the same subject , I should like to present today with pleasure my full support for the report by Mr Morillon . 
after the adoption - as we hope , of a number of amendments tabled by our group , I believe that the adoption of the motion for a resolution well without difficulties to be arranged . 
I shall therefore limit myself to a number of points , which seems to me in the context of this very turbulent spring 2003 seem particularly important . 
this context is not good for the fledgling European security and defence policy , the ESDP . 
since 11 September 2001 is the European Union in political and military terms , to marginalisation a large extent , be it in the Afghanistan- or the Irakfrage or with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
our presence is not zero , but it is reduced in civil and humanitarian actions . 
this is very important , but it is not enough . 
far worse is , however , that in this period divisions within the Union . 
despite the commendable efforts of the Greek Presidency , the adoption of common positions , to achieve remain shared the opinions in the Irakfrage , both in terms of the kind of our transatlantic relations and our Grades to autonomy , with regard to the United States and , as the logical consequence - in terms of certain principles as the use of violence , the importance of international law or the role of the United Nations . 
but despite this dark situation loudly and clearly , I would like to express my conviction that we must give under any circumstances . 
some countries - Belgium , Germany , France and Luxembourg , have already been launched an initiative of the security and defence policy , in order to relaunch . 
Greece , which holds the Unionsvorsitz , has responded positively , as the Prime Minister Simitis stated recently . 
I hope that the convention , with its chairman Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing after a few weeks of silence and hesitation in this issue , too , proposals . 
excellent ideas on the institutions of the foreign , security and defence policy are already been said by Mr Dehaene and Mr Barnier has been developed which , in fact , with the views expressed by Parliament . 
and today in the report , Mr Morillon , a whole range of interesting proposals , for example , to the objectives of the CFSP and the ESDP under the new international conditions , on the new role of NATO , the relations between the European Union and NATO , the military capabilities , particularly in the Hochtechnologiebereich which we simply need to be credible . 
of course , it is not a question of compete with the United States . 
that would be completely unwise and impossible . 
rather , it is a certain basically simple situation to be taken into account . 
because of its geographical proximity and its common borders are the countries of Europe together in actual fact , in the security . 
because of its traditions , particularly in cultural point of view , they have important values and principles to defend in the world . 
and finally , the Europeans are due to their resources and the economic policy instruments which they have put in place , in a position to spread its ideas and their interests , if necessary , to defend throughout the world , if they wish to . 
in short , the Europeans have quite simply a role to play in the world , without this , but we also want to dominate without any subordination and without a whatever sort of Untertänigkeitsverhältnis . 
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , you do it ! 
this is in line with the wishes of Parliament , which will support you . 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Morillon regrets that I in his opening of the debate was not present . 
this report may not be more topical . 
if - which is probably - the American and British forces now have the control of Baghdad can now , then the debate on the impact of the war and to ziehenden lessons from the start . 
in contrast to its predecessors shows the current administration only low level of interest in a strong and unified Europe . 
our weakness is bloßgelegt cruelly , and it is now the duty of the EU , to develop a Sicherheitsstrategie us in the redefine the transatlantic relations can be helpful . 
the Members of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party in this House is very much welcome the report by Mr Morillon as an important contribution to this process . 
the European differences of opinion on the subject of Iraq have clearly demonstrated that we are not able , in terms of security issues to speak with one voice and , however , we should not forget that Europe on a common trade policy , a joint development policy and on a particularly entstehendes diplomatic corps in the form of Kommissionsbüros in the world . 
these are powerful instruments , which could be much more powerful , if they as part of an integrated foreign policy linked with each other . 
our foreign policy is inconsistent , because it on three Commissioners , the Council presidency and the High Representative of the Council is distributed and because some Member States to deny that we have fundamental common interests in the field of foreign policy , or the Commission , to take a leading role . 
without a common defence policy , it is Europe in the for a credible common foreign policy necessary military influence are lacking . 
our common defence expenditure amount to less than half of the expenditure of the United States and make it clear that the EU does not invest enough in the defence of our citizens have higher Verteidigungsetats would welcome . 
it will not be enough to invest , more simply : we must use the funding more effectively , especially for fundamental requirements , such as strategic Lufttransporte Präzisionslenkwaffen and Tankflugzeuge . 
that is why the Liberal Group supports the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency armament and research to control the defence expenditure . 
we want to begin cheaper and , if the EU countries also think that , outside the EU produced supplying arms are able to meet our criteria and the cheapest , are then should we not in a fehlgeleiteten Anflug of protectionism choose the European option . 
in this way we would be repeating the mistakes of the common agricultural policy . 
more effective defence expenditure must go hand in hand with a greater decision-making . 
Parliament cannot with its clear and unanimous message in favour of a strong and effective European Security and Defence Policy to the European convention in the form of the report of General Morillon hope influence on the discussions . 
by the appointment of a single representative for Foreign Affairs , the from the ranks of the Commission , but additional resources and know-how from the Member States , we will be a great deal of progress on the approximation of the grundverschiedenen elements in the field of foreign and security policy . 
we also have a greater flexibility in the introduction and implementation of crisis management of the and in favour of a wider scale if necessary , to the constructive abstention . 
there are clear reservations about this possibility , but the introduction of a clause to the collective defence in the new constitution-treaty , similar to that of the Treaty on the Western European Union , clause contained also seems to be necessary . 
this may not immediately progress with all 15 Member States , let alone with 25 Member States will be achieved . 
that is why I welcome the initiative of the Belgian government , in this month a meeting with France , Germany and Luxembourg to issues of defence policy . 
progress in the European integration can often only by the resolute use of a group of determined countries , which is a matter moving and the other countries . 
nevertheless , I am standing in the view that greater cooperation in relation to defence all the governments , which would continue to participate , should be open and that the British Government in particular , because of its military capacity and experience will . 
finally , I would like to point out that a European security and defence policy by NATO guaranteed collective Sicherheitsstruktur can supplement , as long as there is a rationalisation of the Rüstungsbeschaffung , a added value in the form of a doctrine on the basis of conflict prevention and crisis management and a credible threatened use of military measures and a much more coherent and common approach to the security policy . 
let us of our European Security and Defence Policy , on the Amboss of hope and from the steel our ashamed with a view to Iraq . 
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Morillon that , at the beginning of his report he has pointed out , as the guiding principle of the European foreign and security policy . 
in its considerations already he says - in my opinion , and rightly so - that the crisis must be the guiding principle . 
only in emergency situations , only in crisis situations , the European Union should also on military resources . 
it is precisely this order is supported by my group , and that is why we are also in favour of , for example , the use of the European Union in Macedonia and Bosnia . 
this means that the European Union , finally , I would say , on the buried last funds in the Gesamtspektrum of foreign and defence policy instruments . 
in addition to the diplomacy , in addition to economic resources now also military resources , but if you please in this order . 
I would like to highlight two chapters of the report closer . 
first of all , the General - in my opinion rightly - by means of an amendment proposed that a certain point in the eyes of the comments contained in his report already as yet , which is the need for a strategic approach . 
what are the specific objectives of the European security policy ? 
where do we want ? 
what we need this ? 
when we want to do this ? 
such an approach , I believe that this is an excellent report . 
I am also an absolute advocates a review of the Petersberg tasks - that the official description of our in my opinion , far too limited strategic approach . 
I am , however , for then , to start and only then , for example , to discuss on the territorial defence , including in the report by Mr Morillon , in my view , only volatile comments . 
this is now suddenly to the tasks of the European Union to be added ? 
we must Article 5 of the WEO-Vertrags ? 
I believe that such a decision to be premature . 
first of all , we should deal with the strategic approach and then to consider what these European instruments should be achieved . 
similarly , I think it would be too early to say that in the year 2009 should we be able to have a role to play as in Kosovo . 
comes the examination of the strategic concept and then the adoption of this type of specific tasks . 
secondly , another important point of the report which often existing misunderstanding , although , as well as the contributions of Mr Patten and Mr Watson - is a little angeklungen , it would not have sufficient financial resources for the vorzusehenden actions available to us . 
the problem , ladies and gentlemen , is not that too little money is available , but that it is not enough and efficient enough and that it will be used so far has been in a Arbeitsspezialisierung . 
where the problem lies . 
let us be quite clear about this . 
I am very pleased that it is also in the report by Mr Morillon expressed clearly . 
with regard to the financing begrüßenswerterweise - I am in favour of the rapporteur - the gradual transmission of the financial resources of , in my view , completely non-transparent national Ad-hoc-Haushalten between Member States , the any democratic control , to the EU budget . 
there are many arguments as to whether it is only the impact on the European defence policy , the European Parliament at last in this respect , as the defence expenditure to be financed from the Community budget . 
finally , I would like to a point of my main concern is . 
in this Parliament , and also with the Council , we are agreed that the effectiveness of should be increased . 
we must be able to act faster and more efficient . 
I agree , ladies and gentlemen , but then , if you please on the basis of a specific strategic plan . 
my fear is , however , that a fundamental Zubehör , namely the democratic control , there is a lack of this . 
a further increase the effectiveness and improve our potential without clarity about where the democratic control of security policy , is not . 
if we are in favour of the majority of Parliament - and I think that qualified majority voting in the area of security policy , then we must want - in the exercise of democratic control of the European Parliament cannot be excluded . 
effectiveness is necessary , but if you please , together with democratic control , and this must be ultimately here in this Chamber . 
Mr President , the recent international events have demonstrated once again , as we urgently need a European Union , which is capable of action for the closed , both when there is to defend their own safety , and , if it is necessary , the right of each people to the quest for a democratic and pluralist , the rights of individuals and to protect the rights of wahrenden system ; a Europe that the diplomacy at long last , the diplomatic services - and the information systems of each Member State can , in order to bring together those cooperation , which the Council that we need to our eyes , and always with the problems of the world politics , in order to be able to reach decisions behind which so far as possible the whole of the Union . 
it is of primärer importance , the whole of the foreign and security policy debate and the subsequent ableitenden decisions again in the framework of the Council . 
it is also of primärer importance , a single European representative for these two areas of policy . 
with this subject has also aware of the convention . 
by some Member States are actually outside of the Council &apos; s meetings are held , legitimate initiatives , but they are no initiatives of the European Union . 
that is why it is obvious that we are facing a European security and defence policy , the also through a military instrument , such as the proposed by Mr Morillon preserve the peace and democracy , can guarantee give our support . 
this European forces to be the national armed forces of all the Member States will arise , and also to the development of citizenship an additional impetus , because this is Inter alia from the proud feeling that every citizen , whether its belonging to his country and to the Union must feel : a free and independent European Union , winner of a project of peace and mutual respect for the rest of the world , a project that not only to the presentation of documents , noble declarations of intent or the manufacture of trading relations must be based , but with proper powers for the fight against terrorism and the defence of our values of our vision of the world and , where our liberal institutions . 
Mr President , it is always the same again . 
if the reality of the European Chimären transgresses , then we will develop &apos; europabewegten &apos; Träumer straight to new and even absurdere ideas , both in a headlong , which would be ridiculous , would it not dangerous . 
with the report , Mr Morillon us today is the myth which places of a European defence , which , moreover , presented an old hat one can . 
it was already the whole of the twentieth century through the dream of einfältigen Geistern - without any practical result . 
already Aristide Briant widespread this idea with the dramatic result , the resistance and the Verteidigungsbereitschaft in France . 
this has been 1948 fixe idea on the Congress in The Hague aufgetischt again and then 1950 of a certain Winston Churchill with the EVG adopted by the from its Träumereien was born and key brake . 
we must also thank the French Parliament , the it to put an end to it . 
fifty years later , we are still in the same point , in other words , there are no progress has been made . 
we have made some progress so little that the key element of a common defence policy , the establishment of a European defence industry - not only not make progress , but a backward step , since , as we hardly pointed out , the Europeans should buy the majority of weapons with each other but not to approximately 60 % of the United States . 
this would be a beginning , if we want a defence policy is to be the speech . 
however , these defence policy is a myth which places , because there is no defence policy without a common foreign policy . 
although this was in 1992 in ehernen credit in title V of the Maastricht Treaty , but it is enshrined in any crisis , either in Rwanda , in Afghanistan in Kosovo , yet even been achieved . 
this is not possible to achieve because we all share the United States hinterherliefen blind . 
and now they platzt once again , the common foreign and security policy . 
we should no longer these Chimären nachlaufen . 
Europe must be based on the realities . 
and the realities , as is now clearer than ever , the Member States will be visible . 
this must not allow one of its main components : the desire to defence and the necessary resources . 
I will confine myself here to express the wish that France , whose global responsibility to widen , will be to strengthen its own Verteidigungsmittel , because this is the only one that the best contribution to the what Europe can make still remains . 
Mr President , with the words of a French Komikers : to talk about everything is in all , and vice versa . 
in view of the obvious collective failure of the so-called European Union in areas such as economic growth and employment , the rapporteur , unfortunately , it seems to forget that he General of the French army , for a Verteidigungskonzept is a purely and simply a gradual implementation France to a level which is currently - would mean that , if anything , the Belgium will entirely meet ! 
this will , of course , tirelessly of all those who , for various reasons , which is in the concept of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; see a possibility , a up against stumbling blocks were possible to rejuvenate concerning European unification process . 
the current war in Iraq should , however , for all these Schöngeister at long last , be an opportunity to understand that the nations kaltblütige monster , are the only in their own interests . 
the recent failure of the European Transportflugzeugs , that is a much more quickly and much cheaper can be produced , which would have had endless Geschachere at the GALILEO project , the extremely high costs each Rüstungsfabrikation on multinational basis , the fate of hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are threatened - all that has no significance for these Berufspolitiker , whose only aim is , so long as possible in power . 
the enlarged Europe needs stability , but this cannot , of course , we always be achieved by new legal Kunstgriffe , unpraktizierbare cooperation , unfähige organisms , supposed powers or are Vortäuschungen . 



whatever our current differences to be Nahostproblematik all Eurosceptic without exception and without reservations this fixe idea of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; . 
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it has always been my dream , after a de Gaulle to talk about , but not for a that such speeches . 
we are now , when we this debate on the future of European security and defence policy , lead to witness the war in Iraq . we have believed that this war with diplomatic means to be able to prevent . 
but we are a failure , because we were across the political and military existent because we were not . 
when it comes to war or peace , once again , we were not prepared . 
we have come too late , as in Bosnia , as in Kosovo or , as in Afghanistan . 
in any of these armed conflicts , the European Union , as an international player mitbestimmt what is happening . 
that is why it is one of the Kernsätze of the report Morillon that only a Union with clearly defined foreign policy objectives and interests , equipped with effective military capability , that counts . 
such a Union can only a self-employed player in world politics and so that a selbstbewusster partners in the transatlantic relations . 
there is now so many head of government , given its powerlessness in the Irak-Krieg thinks that they should now öffentlichkeitswirksam the objective of a European Verteidigungsunion thereof . 
I ask myself this : are these Government because it is not in the decisions since Helsinki in 1999 involved ? 
why did they do not do more , so that the Rapid Einsatztruppe of the EU &apos; s on the ball , those who are still online 2003 at the most advanced levels and with the relevant Kommandostrukturen and transport capacity ; ? 
why has the Anpassungsreform their national armed forces behind the new Sicherheitsherausforderungen back ? 
why were the reversed seeing in this way ? 
why did you for the transportation of its own soldiers in their own country to the Flugzeugvermieter Ukraine ? 
the European Parliament has continually since 1999 , that the foreign policy instruments of the Union to be supplemented military capabilities . 
of course , it is now in the convention . 
this report is also the European Parliament &apos; s contribution to the future : how can the European Union to protect the safety of their citizens with new threats by terrorism and how can the European Union to peace and stability in the world ? 
because Präventivkriege without legitimacy we must never again ! 
that is why we support in this report all those who , in the Convention for the updating of the Petersberg tasks , which are in favour of that a vanguard of Member States military Krisenmissionen can take the for a kind of European Rüstungsagentur are setting up of a European Beistands- and Solidaritätsklausel and in particular , the crucial point of majority decision-making in the foreign policy and the intensified cooperation to introduce the defence policy . 
we believe , however , governments should , on the following points be quite clear : millions of people have in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges in the roads of the cities of Europe also demonstrated in favour of that war and peace , but parliaments no Kabinette have to decide . 
whoever facility of a European Einsatztruppe decides needs a very high level of democratic legitimacy . 
let me a final opinion : all future facility in the context of the ESDP will be given a civil and military part . 
it is precisely this is what us by the NATO . 
in Bosnia , we have now with a police mission . 
perhaps next year we solve the SFOR-Mission of NATO . 
we can cohesion between civil and military operations , if the best guarantee for both the same rules , and it is the joint costs , on the budget of the European Union to be financed . 
this has to do with parliamentary control , but from their gain governments also democratic support and support for their actions . 
the citizens of the European Union at any rate , of course , already say in the report , Mr Morillon &apos; s concept of a European defence policy . 
71 % of the citizens of Europe are in favour of this . 
only the Kabinette have not yet understood . 
Mr President , I would also like to Mr Morillon , on his excellent report , and I can already tell you that I can , some of the objectives and proposals , most of support . 
as has already been said , the debate to find an appropriate time . 
the war in Iraq has divided Europe . 
that is why , also in the public opinion , doubts as to the ability of the European Union , going to außereuropäischer level , with one voice . 
today &apos;s debate on the European defence policy , therefore , is a quite improper this at the moment . 
the idea are , however , not silent and , without new initiatives could the angerichtete damage does not be wiedergutgemacht . 
in the European Convention is currently on the strengthening of the Beschlussfassungsstrukturen . 
the report , Mr Morillon , contains a whole series of practical proposals to improve the Verteidigungsfähigkeit of the EU . 
we support the enlargement of the Petersberg tasks , which should also include the fight against terrorism . 
the Schnelleingreiftruppe must be more attention . 
if , in future , truly independent operations of this force to be possible to do this , it is also a more efficient organisation of the defence industry in Europe . 
in implementation of all these objectives would in fact , the European Union with a useful military capacity . 
the European Union will then have still not a military superpower . 
this is not the intention . 
in the context of a comprehensive security policy , with particular emphasis on the European Union must crisis the simultaneous use of several instruments . 
such a concept is a credible military component . 
the Irakkonflikt has made bewusster our weaknesses , but this is no reason for complete amendment of the Grundkonzepts . 
the European Union must , together with other countries , and within multilateral framework to be able to accept their responsibilities when it comes to maintain the international legal system . 
the recommendation , the development of the foreign and security policy with a vanguard active Member States to be speeded up , deserves support . 
the pace must not more by the principle of be determined . 
however , I am for an open process . 
anyone who would like to endorse must have the opportunity to them . 
Mr President , the report Morillon deals with the European defence as part of a realistic and responsible strategy of solidarity and complementarity with the United States and is therefore a committed step forward , of the forecasts , economic victims and military investment . 
it is a necessary and urgent step , in which the new terrorist and state threats not be underestimated . 
a Agenda , which is in line with my proposals , which I last year with the study &apos; A European sword &apos; have tabled . 
the report avoid dangerous illusions the neither the security and democracy in the world would strengthen the unity of Europe . 
these dangerous delude ourselves to the rebirth together a unilateral Pazifismus , a return to the previous unilateral Pazifismus of the &apos; prefer red as dead &apos; . 
a further illusion is the a Europe that independent , strong and einflussreich is because it is of the United States has losgesagt : an illusion , which is the fault of the USA-feindlichen and for the European supranational policy unempfänglichen Gaullismus , especially in the field of foreign and defence policy . 
it is an illusion , the deep in the European nationalism and in now is firmly rooted in ideologies an illusion , which has the strange Rechts-Links-Bündnis in relation to the war in Iraq declared and on the other hand , the principle of democratic intervention has magnified . 
these political illusion is more dangerous than the imperiale Unilateralismus and of Pazifismus : with the claim that Europe to manage , he has divided ; he has divided the Fifteen , he has insulted the countries of Eastern Europe , while the Wiedervereinigungsprozess was that he has the distance from the United States increased and before the possibility of the right of veto contributed to cripple the Security Council , so that he justifications for the military intervention outside of the UN gave . 
before the European Union the development of the institutional system , it must reallocate their political vision ; it must make it clear to the safety of their population , their own territory and its borders ensure - and what they failed in the Balkans - it must be the erosion of the Rüstungskontrolle and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to take note of bloody dictatorships , and they must strongly against terrorism and for the safety of Israel , and also a democratic Palestinian State . 
if the Union a neither unterwürfige still hostile , neither resigned still dependent allies of the United States wants to be , it must build a common defence and gradual the leadership of the Atlantic Alliance , in which the United States now only 8 % of their armed forces have committed . 
in order to do this , it is of the agreement of Saint-Malo between France and Great Britain and of this report by Philippe Morillon , because they start today the culmination of the preparation of the European security policy , the consolidated and , on the whole of the Union must be extended . 
Mr President , we should discuss the matter today , as we European security and how we guarantee the future for all of us are able to make sure . 
in particular in the last few years and on 11 September , we have seen that military weapons is no guarantee of security . 
quite the opposite , one could say because , if a country in the world is ready military well , it is the United States , the victims of a Terroraktion on 11 September . 
this terrorist attack by the previous armament was therefore not be prevented . 
the Rechtsruck , which is in the United States has taken place in this area , heaven forbid the security considerations influence in Europe . 
there is - global and within the EU - a complete discrepancy between the investment in military equipment and our investment in a truly sustainable security . 
the problem is that the report Morillon these abuses not eliminated , as one of the reasons for this is that I cannot support it in the final analysis , although he many good and right analyses , on the need for a European identity in these areas . 
but if these identity is something that we should be to follow what is already as ineffectual that has proved ineffective and we are on the wrong track . 
this is not a sign of Pazifismus , because I believe that a nation has the right to defend its own rights , and I also believe that it can be situations in which military power to the peace building is necessary . 
but the threat that we are facing , not by military means . 
it is in the first place , the desperation of people in a very unfair world , and we should focus our efforts . 
Madam President , allow me to begin by thanking Mr Morillon , for the effort which he has made Zusammentragen of the different viewpoints . 
Mrs Frahm from my Group has already stated that we will have the report despite its positive content from three clear reasons not able to accept : 
the first reason is our dependence of NATO , a fact that the European Union , in addition to the American giants as a Zwerg can be , and , if the European Union , then they need to develop its own personality . 
otherwise , there is no future for the European Union . 
the second reason is the need for , after the end of the war in Iraq display determined , because we must make it very clear that the current risk in the world the aggressive behaviour of the United States . 
this on 20 September presented by the United States strategy paper means that wars in the whole world . 
as of next will Syria , Iran , Korea to the number - who knows ? 
I do not want to name any objectives , in order to suggest . 
it is a major threat of safety . 
my third point is , therefore , the European Union is a fundamental role in the democratic strengthening of the United Nations and of the Security Council must play . 
we also have to work , conflicts in line with the law necessarily before the General Assembly and the UN Security Council - and that to the United States do not . 
the contribution that the European Union has carried out , is a success . 
we are of many countries South America have been said , despite the fact that , in my opinion , completely unjustified - pressure has carried out , the President Mr Aznar , so that the two countries , which are members of the Security Council , the war against Iraq , these dignity and courage , reacted and Europe gave an example , peace and international law in favour of a more important than the dangerous Abenteuern of the United States . 
Madam President , in his explanatory statement for an EU armed force writes General Morillon : &apos; if the governments of the Member States it will continue to leave the Americans , any wars , and only with questions of peace , then I think the Union must accept that it is the role of the Athens in the old Rome : is the case in the final analysis , we accept that the wishes of a new Empire &apos; . 
since I prefer Athens , the cradle of culture and of democracy , the separate Rome , which the whole world and , ultimately , the enemy in blood and fire was sinking , while the Greek heritage in all areas weiterlebt , of the Olympic Games to the EU-Ratsvorsitz . 
general Morillon wants , that the EU is doing the same as the United States in Kosovo , or perhaps in Iraq or in one of the other smaller countries , against the United States in the last century Angriffskriege . 
he wants , that the EU in the entire planet while not accepting , particularly in the Balkans , in the Middle East , in the Caucasus region , in Mittelasien and Africa , militarily routine . 
in such a scenario remains , of course , no room for non-aligned countries . 
all are bound by a so-called Solidaritätsklausel , and a UN mandate is absolutely no longer be necessary . 
if the EU the Roman way of General Morillon , can it be done , that of a fine day a EU-Präsident alongside the President of the United States debated in what oil and mineralreichen developing country the poor next time in the Steinzeit zurückgebombt . 
any attempt , in the militärtechnischen area with the United States , however , mitzuhalten runs the risk that the lethal arms race of the Soviet Union repeatedly . 
certainly the Europeans will then billion people attach as well as the Americans . 
million will be demonstrators in the EU embassies demonstrate the Eiffelturm will be the fate of the World Trade Center share , the UN , will undermine the Zivilisationskrieg will spread and the European population , which continue to fall , will be the losers , as many Superwaffen following the example of the United States and we are also move . 
if General Morillon with his views across , we embarked on best mentioned the book &apos; The sinking of the Abendlandes &apos; of Oswald Spengler from the Regal , in order to understand what will happen . 
if we , as General Morillon the which aspires to try to build a modern Rome , we shall also be the fate of Roms . 
no , we are the plans for a military superpower ad once and let us listen to our Sacharow-Preisträger ! 
we take the Dalai Lama &apos; s seriously , our guest was ! 
the European Union has only as a factor for a chance of survival and a raison d &apos; être . 
let us at long last , a civil peace corps under EU-Regie matters . 
instead of making a fool us , we should prefer lessons from the experience of the Member States , which are 200 years have been able to look at the from wars . 
the specific characteristics of the European Union is of the peace process . 
should the United States war , but until the Americans themselves sink in blood and fire , such as the Römer ! 
but let us in the culture and democracy stick to Athens ! 
Madam President , the events of 11 September 2001 , the world remember that we are not a matter of peace and security . 
in this light , it is commendable that the European countries feel the need to have a greater responsibility for themselves . 
at stake , namely our own credibility and safety . 
this is not by fluctuation . 
it is the report Morillon was quite right to the view that , in relation to the collective defence NATO is still the crucial bonds , at the same time , however , the development of an autonomous European security and defence policy . 
not to mention the wholly inadequate Verteidigungsanstrengungen at European side . 
in short , the report Morillon shows no clear way . 
what is naheliegender as an adequate contribution of the EU Member States in the NATO ? 
one thing is certainly : in connection with Iraq to implement days disagreement between the European members , as well as the controversial initiative , a group for the European defence policy , not helping to ensure that the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy is currently a credible basis for the safety of the citizens in the countries of Europe . 
these citizens are served by a unanimous strong NATO . 
Madam President , between the date of drawing up of the report , Mr Morillon , and today there are major international developments which will have the effect that the issues of the defence of Europe will no longer be dealt with globally and a uniform manner . 
we can no longer act as if there is still in the establishment of a common defence policy for the purpose of the implementation of a common foreign and security policy of all the Member States . 
the arguments of the Security Council on basic issues have taken place , then the beginning of a further after the war in Kosovo , this time against Iraq , in violation of the provisions of the Charter of San Francisco have the considerable differences clearly , what between the present and future Member States of the European Union in the field of foreign policy . 
it is patently clear have two Konzeptionen of Europe and its role , two types of foreign policy , two opinions of the international order . 
we must take note of this . 
it would be the wrong way forward if we were versteifen is only a the circumstances , to see geschuldete crisis , which , as soon as they should have passed - which would allow us to us back to the old approaches and to return to the widely one , in essence little semantic games in connection with the CFSP and the ESDP to start again . 
in the future for everything that can at Union level , with foreign affairs and defence , only the concept of variable geometry . 
in this previously fakultativen approach is no way now more over . 
it is a variable geometry , which , furthermore , more efficiency and less idle chit-chat . 
the convention should now his talents in this respect . 
in the report , Mr Morillon &apos; s proposals must be flexible between those who , by recent developments , have become totally obsolet and those who are still used . 
in the first category , I would , in particular , paragraph 54 integrated , in the suggests that the European Union a permanent seat in the UN Security Council . 
this proposal is clearly contrary to the current needs of Europe , continue to two constant members of the Security Council needs , so that the two different Konzeptionen , the two different Hauptwege which the countries of Europe , can be expressed . 
in the second heading in my opinion , the proposals to the necessary cooperation , the first in the field of the fight against terrorism , what the consequences of the Irakkrieges will be more necessary than ever , and , secondly , in the area of production and the Kaufes must be developed , of course . 
the recent events have shown , also to make it quite clear what damage in Europe , with the ideology of the Friedensdividende has been done . 
I welcome , therefore , the concept of Community preference in the report Morillon in zweckdienlicher way , which has surfaced once again , however , I regret that this with his disappearance in another also coinciding strategically important area : the the CAP , i.e. the competence in the food or , at the American terminology - to use the Nahrungsmittelwaffe . 
the security of supply , as stated in the report , Mr Morillon , is to say , must for food as for supplying arms . 
it must be to guarantee that Commissioner Lamy this in the negotiations of the Doha-Runde not forgets . 
Mr President , we know that discussions on a common security and defence policy at the moment , for the supporters of the realistic or even überrealistischen school a kind of wishful thinking . 
however , it is precisely in the current circumstances , this report , with its Denkanstößen concern of all the more widely . 
in essence , we can only support this report , because it is based on fundamental arguments , on the European Parliament and among the citizens of the Union , there is agreement in particular , to respect the principles of the UN Charter and of international law , to a framework for the guidelines of the common foreign policy , the the Security and Defence Policy , on the need for us that Europe responsibility in the field of security and defence policy , starting of military assistance for humanitarian Hilfseinsätze , conflict prevention and -lösung to the maintenance of transatlantischer relations and a multilateral approach . 
I would like to point out that , but critical of the report perhaps too much in the depth and even contains some details , which are clearly not be too . 
if , for example , paragraph G the Kriegsrecht should be mentioned , is not clear whether the Geneva Convention is criticised now or not . 
furthermore , I do wonder in the current at the question is : should we not more attention to the existing resources , if we want to streamline our expenditure merge , Doppelungen and avoid the interoperability between the armed forces of our countries ? 
one could around the sektorenweise distribution of appropriations for the defence in each country be improved . 
some countries give , 70 % or more for staff and maintenance . 
they could maybe a joint contribution to a priority , such as the scientific and technical research , which is to modern systems in the rule results which both industry and the economy can be of use . 
having said that this is a debate on very practical matters which can start only right now . 
Madam President , the events of the last time show that the EU Member States either now or in the future will be able to the organisation of a common defence to . 
the EU Member States , the members of NATO , represented quite different views in relation to the Irakkrieg , as far as the general attitude of these countries to the new world order , which is emerging . 
this makes it difficult to create a common defence policy . 
the neutral Member States and do not want that the EU is to become a military alliance or or a military superpower . 
under these circumstances it would be reasonable if the EU will continue to crisis management and the NATO as a system of collective safety for the EU Member States , the an organisation want to be a part of such as this . 
Germany , France , Belgium and other gleichgesinnte countries could have a close mutual military cooperation within NATO and a defence community , which is a strong European pillar of the NATO would operate . 
this system would the cooperation between Europe and North America , which is very important to us all . 
in NATO Europe could have its own defence identity , but the defence community would cooperate closely with the United States . 
the other EU Member States - both the members of NATO and the neutral , would , for its part to play a role in the process of the transatlantic link , to maintain and consolidate . 
the creation of a defence community could even turn into a more general internal differentiation within the Union on the basis of considerations , the leading French and German experts and politicians have employed over the years . 
then let different institutions to the heart of the Union , such as the German Foreign Minister , Mr Joschka Fischer has proposed . 
Madam President , I believe that all members of the European Parliament are on 18 years , our average age is in 40 or 50 , and that is why we should not play with Zinnsoldaten . 
I am not General and this is not , therefore , I have just been carried out , without my therefore wish to have been appointed to be Unteroffizier . 
I can , however , while I am speaking here , not the Fotografie on the front page of the newspaper &apos; The &apos; s Guardian by my internal eye , which shows where these conduct preventative wars use . 
and I can also not from my memory remove five minutes , what I have seen on television , namely a people which not only bombarded since days ago , but it is up to the redundant has been out of humiliation borders , with plundering , theft and all the what we in the television with . 
do we have here before visitors in these circumstances , journalists , before the interpreters on arms and mechanisms , rather than to discuss our to focus attention on this , where we are ? 
we can accept in Paragraph 17 , by the &apos; krisenpräventiven nature &apos; military action , of course , the question is , if a preventative war that is what Mr Bush and Blair in Iraq have begun ? 
we can accept paragraph 9 , which states that terrorism the idea of geografisch limited military commitments lapses have been made and the traditional distinction between the policy of the external and internal security has drawn conclusions ? 
what do we do ? 
we are opening even wide open the door for a war in Syria , in Iran , in North Korea and later , Mr Morillon , in France . 
for this reason , this is a useful debate . 
to see where we face . 
not to say that it is bad for us to be divided over . 
to say that what the two sides in the European Union right . 
the side of the principles of the Charter in the United Nations Security Council has violated or the side , the a action in accordance with the UN has supported ? 
to analyse the political basis on which we are going to ask the European Union , which is not a real caricature of the United States , but will be a Pol of peace , the diplomacy and the restrained action in a twenty-first century , which is no point in the twentieth century same . 
Madam President , Commissioner , as has been aware that Europe , despite the fact that there is the most important commercial power , only be a very important role to play in the world stage , if it on a common foreign and security policy , the so-called third pillar in the Treaty of Maastricht and the creation of einsatzbereiter militärsicher capacity to ensure peace of the priorities . 
in a world which is increasingly global and vernetzter , it is so far been our policy , to establish international law , particularly on the United Nations , but also on other global organisations . we therefore have a legal framework for the international relations is being redesigned , because we are convinced that this is the best way to prevent any disputes or to deal with them . 
and we believe that the European Union within this world order should speak with one voice , the it as a trade , economic and social power and a great defender of the human rights , the Multikulturalismus caveat so and the environment . 
the reality of our current situation , however , is disappointing . 
once again , the Home division on at various summits made grandiose statements by the Heads of State and Government prevailed . 
I refer to the different positions which the fifteen countries in the United Nations Security Council to the conflict in Iraq have represented . 
the behaviour of Mr Aznar , the Spanish head of government , and various others , would be as reprehensible alone , therefore , to call this division , because it has caused . because rather than on the adoption of a common position adopted by the Council to wait for the European Union , springing from it quickly and the instructions of the spoken , create a new abandon unilateral world order . 
the worst thing is that Mr Aznar and his colleagues an illegal war , have encouraged a humanitarian disaster in each of children , women and civilians were killed , mutilated or were injured and in fear of hunger and disease . 
and the worst thing is that Mr Aznar has contravened the constitution , without the approval of the European Parliament or the consent of the King of Spain , and that he , together with its Getreuen contrary to the global opinion and the opinion of the weapons inspectors and without the support of the UN Security Council . this has acted the law and the international institutions and a powerful blow to the Stärksten victims of the world , the violence and open the way the reason and justice , second and third pillars . 
in conclusion , I should like to say that we owe it to them , once again that the world governed by the law of the jungle and that the third pillar of the European Union is stuck to . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mr Philippe Morillon , on his excellent report . 
this debate and also the fact , as a few amendments it relatively , has shown that it has understood , in this very important issue a very broad consensus in this House . 
if we do with the situation before five years in similar debates to compare we see that , today , there is a very broad consensus on the need for a European Verteidigungsbeitrags in this House . 
I would like to congratulate Philippe Morillon for this . 
his report is an important building block in the development of a Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
why is it necessary ? 
we have in September of last year , the new Sicherheitsstrategie taken note of the United States . 
we are at the moment , such as this week after week , the United States Sicherheitsstrategie systematically is implemented . 
what we as Europeans , there is a need for a European Sicherheitsstrategie answer . 
it is essential that we as Europeans than building block of a common foreign policy first jointly define our security interests . 
I believe that this is perfectly possible . 
firstly , there is a broad consensus that we , as the European Union to capable of us in the framework of NATO , together with our allies , if necessary , but also against any possible Angreifer autonomously to defend themselves . 
I would very much welcome it if the convention would here , were to a mutual Beistandsklausel for the new constitution of the European Union . 
secondly , we should develop the abilities . this means that we need a little time , the geographical context of the European Union necessary contributions to the management of crises , and it is true that zivil and militarily . 
this is not yet the case today , we can have not yet autonomous , but this is a capacity that we need to develop . 
thirdly , we should be the European Union to be able to everywhere in the world and Rettungsoperationen at all times , when it comes to the safety of European citizens . 
these are three further building blocks for an Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
if we do , we must develop in the experience , which we take account of in similar major projects have made , as well as for the internal market or in the European currency . 
these were only a success because , that is why we clear content and long-term targets have made , what matters when we wanted to be in a position . 
there are some answers to this question in the report by Philippe Morillon . 
what the citizens of the European Union , is peace , security and stability . 
as a European Parliament , we must make our contribution that the European Union as a whole this claim indeed . 
Madam President , in connection with Iraq schwankte my mood between rage , Bedrückung and determination . 
I am furiously vote in favour of the arrogance and the Selbstüberschätzung of the United Kingdom and the United States , as they have started to have the war . 
I am saddened that the European Union in its efforts to prevent this war , and a peaceful disarming the Iraqis , was to enable powerless . 
but I am also determined to ensure , if I can , with my own small way that we have a rather united , coherent , uniform , common European foreign and defence policy . 
I am convinced that a rather united European Union would have been able to prevent this war , and also to disarm Saddam Hussein , a significant contribution to the production of peace between Israelis and the Palestinians . 
this is a possibility there is still , and we should do everything within our power in order to overcome our relatively passing differences , which in many cases to national self-interest , and in this way , to a common position for Europe . 
we in the world an important role to play in just now , and we should try to this role . 
in view of the most serious Sicherheitskrise after the end of the cold war , we have not been able , as a Union seriously and effective action against this crisis . 
this is very shocking . 
it would be töricht to adopt the war against Iraq would be in a one-off plan for war . 
it is obvious that Syria , Iran and also , of course , Cuba and North Korea also on the list . 
the European Union must at last , the situation now got our act together and make it clear that we have the kind of actions , the against Iraq have begun , and that together we do not support the serious and peaceful mechanisms of the prevention of conflicts are about to set up in order to achieve what the world needs , namely stability and peace . 
the today , at the top of Europe are only prepared the politicians , to speak with one voice when it comes to their own ideas . 
the common foreign and security policy is obviously not important enough for , in order to make concessions . 
as long as the foreign policy in the European Union will continue to renationalised , will be a common defence as a steuerloses Kampfflugzeug pilots , which is arguing , in the air remain depend . 
both the excessive British talks about loyalty to Washington and the permanent French anti-Americanism are not the right guide for the European policy . 
it is to prevent it is absolutely essential that an enlarged Union in a pro- and a antiamerikanisches camp from splintering . 
good transatlantic relations are in favour of Europe , for the United States , as well as for the rest of the world of fundamental importance . 
if the United States their pax Americana can aufoktroyieren , are the today &apos; s political leaders of Europe with fault . 
as long as they say , the severely to what they are right , and Europe as a whole too little in the defence , we are condemned to a Nebenrolle to play in the world stage . 
the European Union must at least on our own continent , preferably be military action within the framework of NATO , but also independently , if necessary . 
by the interdependence and strengthening of the military resources will be the basis for a common and solid security policy . 
the development of a European strategic concept , in which the emphasis on the crisis , is a great objective , which should , however , only then can achieve , if the leaders of Europe exclusively with one voice . 
otherwise they should prefer to keep their mouths . 
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as a member of the GUE-NGL-Fraktion , of course , I share many of the concerns of the majority of my group , and , in particular , I am as it is the question : how can progress be achieved in the defence cultures , if not before , has been set common foreign policy ? 
I should like to say that I have also Präventivkriege such as , of the current in Iraq , in principle and reject the divisions of the countries of Europe , in this important issue regret . 

nevertheless , think and I would like to say that if we are the monopoly of the NATO , as you know , a dominated by the United States , not organisation and conflicts through a strong and effective European diplomacy to regulate , then we must build a Europe of defence . 
we need a sort of Europe with clear objectives and principles , with specific tasks , with adequate capacity and equipment and a legitimate , democratically controlled decision-making process . 
in my opinion , conflicts must throughout the world to diplomatic channels , especially in the context of the UN , to be regulated . 
but in order to have a sufficient diplomatic weight and , therefore , conflicts with diplomatic means to be able to resolve , is a real capacity for implementation of military action , and many others , I also think that Europe must not abandon . 
in short , if Europe fate not in the hands of the United States , it must intends to create the necessary conditions at last , and that the Europe of defence . 
Madam President , rarely does so in good time a report such as General Philippe Morillon , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur : priorities and weaknesses , unfortunately , more weaknesses . 
firstly , this report comes so that in good time before the until the end aufgehobenen debate on the common foreign and security policy in the convention , and secondly , it is at a time when in Europe , the more pressing issue is the direction in which a security and Verteidigungsarchitektur should move , within NATO , or outside NATO , as a partner of the United States in seeing transatlantic alliance or removed from the European Konkurrenzunternehmen in its infancy ? 
the foreign and security policy of the European Union as conflict prevention and strengthen international security is in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and the establishment of a common foreign policy , the the prerequisite for the development of a European defence policy , even as a matter of course , is , in this House controversial , even if it at the latest , since the war in Kosovo is clear that the European Union must be able , peacekeeping and friedensschaffende tasks to carry out what they are already in Macedonia . 
in our attempts are minor Doppelgleisigkeiten , such as , for example , that the NATO its own rapid intervention force , and this has created a Konkurrenzunternehmen to European rapid reaction force has been set up . 
I therefore believe that it is important that , in a Zusatzantrag , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group a permanent task force is asking for which , until 2009 in a Kosovo-ähnlichen conflict in the geographical area of Europe in cooperation with NATO , or even autonomous must be fully . 
this shows an open and try to be aware , the Richtungsstreit within the EU &apos; s first . 
Austria has , since the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam , make it clear that it is in line with solidarity a European security policy . 
we welcome any step , which is in a practicable direction , and therefore support the concept of General Morillon . 
Madam President , the serious international crises to throw a special light on the national differences between the EU Member States . 
although the Union in the area of crisis management a central and successful role in the Balkans and in Afghanistan , we were not played in the situation , promptly and efficiently the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia . 
the Irakkrieg has the differences in the history , Geopolitik and the political priorities arising in the Member States , to the fore . 
by means of the internal political situation in the various Member States will be further encouraged the controversy . 
there is a need for any special cynicism , if you look at the objective of the common European security guarantees for a Utopia . 
however , it is now clear that the NATO and Europe losing more responsibility for their security and defence policy . 
the anerkennenswerte General Morillon &apos; s report is , therefore , to create a favourable time . 
perhaps the current weltpolitische crisis and the Bedrohungsszenarien are really get us for the strengthening of the European voice and ability to act . 
we do not suffice , ambitious objectives . 
we must also determined and practical . 
that is why the European Convention should the Commission &apos; s role in the foreign policy . 
unfortunately , however , things seem to reverse , and the cooperation between the governments adopted . 
once again we are faced with the contradiction between word and deed . 
in the work of the convention is produced at the same time increased activity of certain Member States to Skizzierung of a common defence policy . 
we can adopted by the realistic that within the Union in this area with varying pace , as it also in Schengen and of economic and monetary union was the case . 
but it is important to ensure that no closed clubs are created , which do not have access to all . 
in addition , it would be good , foreign and security policy objectives of the various Member States to learn . 
the Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou has a relevant proposal in this respect . 
in my opinion , this should be tackled . 
if we , for example , resulting from the Geopolitik differences know , we will also see the potential for cooperation . 
Madam President , &apos; Argos speiste it with the blood of the pettifoggery &apos; - this line from a poem Péguys on Homer the critics of the report , I would like to say , Mr Morillon , because of the report by General Morillon is not a myth which places but undoubtedly the most interesting and on sorgfältigsten prepared document on this issue which is in the eyes for years . 

the reasons for this positive assessment of exist in the ambitious objective and in which this proposed realistic way . 

it is already on the adequacy of the report on the current time been pointed out on its comprehensive nature , the previous speakers have stressed . 
I should like , for my part , his sense of perspective and highlight the excellent exposition of the necessary Zusammenspiels submitted to the institutional elements . 
furthermore , I would like to the very creative dealing with the concept of closer cooperation , in realistic and pragmatic way to the defence cultures , in order to be applied in the perspective of a genuine Gemeinschaftsverteidigung . 
it is the Bauanleitung for a Europe of defence which , in this report to the current and future realities and , in particular , to the challenge of terrorism is adapted . 
it is often said that the generals put in their armies last wars . 
I hope that does not take place in the future , new wars , but , as we know , there are many conflicts . 
a General is proposing that we are in favour of the current and future conflicts scenario . 
for that he deserves thanks . 
I do not know whether this terrible neo-colonial war of aggression against Iraq soon will end with safety , but I know that I the victory of American imperialists in a war , which the whole of mankind has opposed to prevent the they not , however , not to celebrate at all . 
a barrier against war by President Bush would have a single position can be of Europe , but the European Union , and is in fact seemed divided and , therefore , powerless and weak . 
the approach of the United States that Europe is in favour of it versagte , was not enough ; it would have a specific opposition from the EU as such to sell . 
never was the lack of a single and united voice so significant as in this tragic situation ; never was the absence of the presence of Europe with its own headquarters so much in the United Nations Security Council . 
Europe can and must in the world only with its own , independent foreign and defence policy by weight , be only a separate and independent economic , political and military force , which are not in contrast to the United States , but of them is independent . 
and Europe should , above all , his provision and his commitment to peace solemnly reaffirm , with a simple and clear explanation of how we they propose in our amendment : &apos; Europe rejects war as a means for resolving international conflict from &apos; . 
Madam President , I can tell you that , in this moment fortunate citizens in a quarter of Baghdad unbewaffneten US-Soldaten , together with a huge Statue of Saddam Hussein from the Sockel . 
the British Conservatives have the quest for an independent European Security and Defence Policy , always as one of the unbesonnensten political objectives of the European Union . 
others have been in turn to the Irrglauben chose that it is the ESDP mainly a question of the European States , assume a more comprehensive contribution to the defence . 
if this could be the case , then it is a commendable aim to act . 
in reality , however , will the transatlantic alliance complicated , it will not be extra troops and it will not created real purpose persecuted , with the exception of a shift in the right to defence and security of Nato-Hauptquartier - where European countries with our American allies in a negotiating table - to the European Union , under the express exclusion of the United States . 
as the presidency has once again this afternoon , there is the ESDP as a priority in the interests of European integration . 
the divisions , the within the context of NATO and elsewhere in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges , there were a conscious consequence of this policy . 
the ESDP is not just a threat to NATO , it is an extremely intergovernmental organisation . 
indeed , the report by my friend , Mr General Morillon has specifically to the objective of a communitarisation of defence policy within the European Union . 
the reservations I have taken note of Commissioner Patten . 
the British Conservatives speaking against this report , the than Gebrauchsanweisung for an EU armed force and an extensive extension of the Gemeinschaftsbefugnisse in the defence and security . it is proposed , the European Commission far-reaching powers for military operations to grant discharge , including the right of initiative in the area of crisis management . 
the Community budget is the general costs for military operations . in addition , it is a common Beschaffungs- and Produktionspolitik on the basis of &apos; of the military needs of the EU as such is &apos; , the establishment of a common Militärakademie of the EU , a clause for collective defence in the form of a Protocol to the EU Treaty , a common EU-Polizeieinheit and a common coast guard authority , and a permanent seat for the EU in the UN Security Council . 
after the British Prime Minister his experience with the Irakkrieg has done , I hope now that it recognises , such as töricht and harmful the establishment of structures , which is only to a deepening the gulf between the countries of Europe and the United States will be holding . 
I also hope that the United States notwithstanding the wide American / British solidarity in the Irakkrise no longer Tony Blairs use for the ESDP are just accepting . 
it should know better and both the consolidation of a new Atlantic Alliance . 
the European Union attaches more importance to their political ambitions as the real security interests of the citizens of its Member States . 
Madam President , the Irak-Krise has the extremely important subject of the common foreign , defence and security policy of the European Union on dramatic been brought into focus . 
the report , Mr Morillon , and the previous report Lalumière the concerns and give Parliament &apos; s observations . 
however , it also illustrate the political Korrelationen . 
a positive example is the latest presence of the European Union in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia . 
however , it is the problem . 
observations , observations that proposals , but when decisions are made , it is only slowly to their implementation . 
I would like to ask you , as it is with the implementation of the Galileo-Programms ? 
as it is with the famous Petersberg-Truppe and the Petersberg tasks ? 
as it is with the Eurofighter ? 
as it is with the programme for the construction of the major Lufttransporters , despite the fact that the last two programmes no programmes of the European Union ? 
sometimes , I wonder , we have not culminate in water to Danaïden-Fass ? 
Europe is a peacekeeping force , it must also , however , power for security and international cooperation . 
Europe must develop its own person and as an equal partner and an ally to act . 
Europe must its decisions both at institutional and practical level . 
the initiative of Germany and the three other countries is , in principle , positive aspect . 
we will see . 
we have often here on the ancient Athens and the old Rome referred ; however , we have also recently different vielfarbig gekleidete kings and leaders , seen from old , untergegangenen colonial Königreichen in goldverzierten car tour the capitals of some European countries paradierten . 
I do not know whether any similarity between with certain European political leaders in a divided Europe is , in certain intervals in Camp David or on the headquarters of the new Rome to present their Empfehlungsschreiben . 
finally , I would like to propose , Commissioner , Minister , that will be examined whether or not it would be better perhaps , be it only symbolic reasons , some of the important meeting political nature , in future , on the location of the European Union , in order to prevent our equality , our potential and to express our outlook symbolic . 
Madam President , in my opinion , the issues dealt with in this report strategic extremely important , but also one of the most urgent European priorities , namely the Union in the context of a uniform and coherent foreign policy not only in the fight against terrorism , but also in the defence and security capable of action . 
I therefore support the report , Mr Morillon , and will support all proposals to this policy areas to give more credibility and seriousness : the increase in the national defence budgets in the context of this European Union &apos; s strategy ; a proportion of the EU &apos; s budget for the promotion of research and development ; one on the integration and the end of a duplication of effort and waste abzielende planning ; Ad-hoc-Kooperationen and closer cooperation , if some Member States from legitimate reasons for this commitment do not want to participate in ; the transparent and effective integration of the European defence in a renewed NATO , or in a Atlantisches alliance , whose inviolability reiterates once again . 
the next serious Irak-Krise must also those who have supported these targets are not before , their Vogelstraußpolitik give up . 
there must be a specific and have launched visionary along the same time as for the monetary union . 
the convention , Madam President , must focus on the opinion of the majority of Europeans hear , together with our Parliament the return of effective Multilateralität and a handlungsfähigen Union . 
Madam President , after the report by General Morillon is the desire to militarisieren , the European Union , and this will also by those who are trying to be paid for peace . 
as the report in line with the constitution of the EU has been prepared , it was possible to demand measures , which we know that they will be implemented anyway . 
in the Treaty should be included a separate Solidaritätsklausel , according to which the Member States are obliged to , among other things , to combat terrorist threats . 
it is the principle of the Präventivkriegs in the EU . 
the military vanguard of the EU Member States will be the opportunity to an even weitergehendere cooperation to do : if the crisis management of the EU in the work of the Kampftruppen will be extended , it is an illegal act without any UN mandate and with contempt for the geographical borders possible . 
the most military countries may be a different guarantee of security in the form of a statement or a protocol in terms of Article 5 of the EC Treaty . 
well , is that the Kriegsfragen power in the Council must decide unanimously . 
that is better than it will fall in the Commission , to decide whether or not an attack has been carried out . 
I would ask you to observe borne in mind that , in the EU countries , which do not want to be a part of Militärbündnis . 
Madam President , the report by Mr Morillon , which we have made it clear that Europe is and a uniform line must step up its military capabilities , if it wants to be a credible player , in this spannungs- and so at the moment , it is precisely the right moment . 
the war in Iraq is such a dramatic event , we must not be surprised if it serious differences of opinion between the Member States has led ; but are already my impression after the first signs of a Meinungsumschwungs visible and is already a great temptation , as it were , on the Siegerseite - the United States - to support , as soon as the battle is over . 
the countries against war , I have already stated , a number of Brosamen abzubekommen and to the kind . 
however , as General Morillon - a French General , but also a great supporters of Europe - has said , we cannot demand in the decision-making process , if we do not share the burden supports . 
I hope that it has quickly a end with the political Wahnvorstellungen that I have just heard in this House and which , according to the United States according to Iraq to Syria , Cuba and what I know what countries are still be attacked . 
the differences between the Member States were not specify in the European public , the large majority against the American action was . 
fortunately , there was in Europe Heads of State and Government , which have been able to the public misstrauen and a own idea of the world peace : a peace , in this case , unfortunately , only by a war could be to make the necessary even more tragedies in the coming years . 
if the Union &apos; s own Verteidigungsfähigkeit - as in the report - and Mr Morillon , have liked to have its own foreign affairs , and it is a primary role in the world , and I only hope that they can then the right decisions know . 
Madam President , two thousand years has said that the Römer Cicero that there are two ways of resolving differences exist - negotiation or violence . 
as for human beings , the latter is intended for wild animals . 
have Ciceros words are still in force . 
we want to solve conflicts as people by negotiations or as wild animals by violence ? 
should the EU on active conflict prevention or more resources for this conflict human being to develop before birth , i.e. additional funds to invest in the military area ? 
can the conflicts of today and tomorrow really will be resolved by military means ? 
I do not think so . 
what can we from the currently taking place in Iraq war and from the fragmentation of the EU in matters of common foreign and security policy learn ? 
I believe that the European Union should step up their international activities , the United Nations and strengthen their capabilities for conflict prevention , rather than and -lösung more energy and resources in a common military defence to invest in the final analysis , however , as Commissioner Patten has stated that national issues . 
the EU should make sure that the reconstruction of Iraq under the auspices of the UN . 
a warring party is not an even-handed and their cannot , therefore , the responsibility for these reconstruction . 
my own country , Sweden is strongly for conflict prevention , peace and crisis management . 
I support Sweden still does not have a common defence or their joint financing . 
nor , we support the idea that certain countries in the common Verteidigungsarbeit could take the lead , or the introduction of a clause to the collective defence . 
the war is too serious a matter in order that it into the hands of the military - not to my honourable colleagues in the General Morillon . 
the most important tasks are the defence of international law , the strengthening of the UN and its work and the creation of comprehensive capacity in the Union to Erkennung , prevention and resolution of conflicts . 
the European Union can here is a major contribution to peace . 
I did Cicero before 2 000 years that only wild animals are trying to solve conflicts through violence . 
it is high time that the EU should have focused on conflicts , instead of going to resolve them . 
Madam President , I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Morillon on his report , the he has presented the right time for two reasons : firstly , the common defence policy is a subject which , in the European Union is being discussed , and on the other hand , the urgently by other Members have already been mentioned . 
at the present time , the Irakkrise is a problem that affects us all . 
but although the problem is a common , has it within the European Union have different solutions , as the Union neither a common foreign policy on a common defence policy . 
perhaps we should remember that , in the introduced the founding fathers of Europe attempted to make the European defence community . 
but the attempt key brake . this report is a positive step , as well as the a couple of years ago by the President &apos;s report . 
it is a long process in which we are working in Europe , in order to create a common defence policy , which is directed against anyone , but on the cooperation with our allies and also with the Alliance , on the other side of the Atlantic . 
this is not a against NATO policy ; a policy designed to the cooperation with NATO is based . 
just as we have managed , in the year 2002 to establish a single currency , in the not each country is involved , however , I am sure will change in the foreseeable future , we must create a common security and defence policy , and in the knowledge that the money is going to cost , but also in the belief that the European Union on the necessary financial resources . 
the convention must take into account in the drafting of the Unionsvertrages . 
Madam President , since the collapse of the real Socialism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union will be a when I say to the distribution of the new markets and of the wealth of the former Socialist countries and the redistribution of the already vergebenen markets . 
therefore , there is a angespannter competition , both between the Member States of the European Union and with the United States . 
at the same time , in the European Union a comprehensive attack on the achievements of workers . 
in order to achieve these objectives , the European defence and security policy , with the support of the report Morillon . 
obviously , there are actually finding excuses : conflict prevention , crisis management , etc . the truth is that a European army is created , with Söldnern by modern education , training and with modern weapons are equipped , whose task is , the interests of big business , wherever it has set and wherever the NATO the orders to intervene , is to defend themselves . 
it is , of course , as the report Morillon state , this is not about the relationship between the European Union and NATO and the United States is considering breaking off . 
on the contrary , there is talk of mutual strengthening and close cooperation with NATO , which is seen as a stroke bonds , that the United States and the interests of Europe . 
it also means that it could not be different , since , amongst other things , for the majority of the Member States of the European Union , the majority of the Member States of the NATO , however , is dominated by the United States and . 
these ties alone would be enough , about the actual nature and the task of the famous ESDP to make this clear . 
the peoples , as we can be sure , no illusion . 
they have had bitter experiences with NATO and the policy of the European Union in security and defence issues of us has profited already . 
the Proklamationen after the events of 11 September , &apos; we are all Americans &apos; , is still in its ears . 
the people saw recently , such as the Member States of the European Union in Prague the new aggressive NATO-Politik Präventivschläge signed , which involves . this is exactly what the American and British imperialists at the moment and what they do in Iraq , if the peoples of permit , will do elsewhere . 
you know , in fact , that the proposals by the military hardware help to strengthen an increase in the military spending , a profitable future of the European defence industry to ensure that they are , however , for their safety , for the income of people and for the peace process does not bode well . 
it is a disgrace that these proposals have been presented by the Greek government and which , without shame , proud of the fact is that the war before the end of the Greek Presidency will be ready . 
this is not a defence and security policy , it is a policy of aggression and insecurity . and it is precisely for this reason , this policy is in contrast to the visions of our peoples , combat it . 
the crime in Iraq , it is now being committed , since we are talking about here , we are , after Yugoslavia and Afghanistan , once again , an idea of the objectives of these policies . 
the people are calling for an diametrically opposed policy , a policy of peace , the peaceful coexistence of the peoples , a policy which is resolving conflicts , without of violence and war to demonstrate , a policy of disarmament and peace . 
they are , of course , this policy , as very their opponents also stemmen against it . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the last Wortbeitrag and even some before that I am always : where doubt aware , for example , a Kommunist as precisely what the people want ? 
others have said here , it is about the distribution of wealth socialism . 
I would like , our citizens would listen more these debates . 
a Social Democrat has , of the &quot; colonial centre Camp David &quot; . 
I wonder what we are of arguments in such a debate , and I wonder whether they even before the citizens of their country , to say . 
if you take , for example , the Kosovo . 
in Kosovo wanted the citizens that the European Union ? . 
? . 
Mr Korakas , to the European citizens , that in the twenty-first century on the continent of Europe no further Massenvergewaltigungen and expulsions . 
that is why the European security and defence policy . 
we have seen that in 1999 , as Europeans we would be in no position to act , if the Americans would not help us . 
this was the Helsinki Summit 1999 . we have come a long way with what we have developed in institutions . 
the report , Mr Morillon , as expressed in the excellent way . on 1 April , we have a small mandate for the first time in Macedonia , also to the pacification in a situation in a country , and not military conflicts , such as the result of some raised here . 
I think that are good signals from Europe , the citizens expect from us . 
the time of our debate on this report is a very important . now it is important that both the two extreme sides - the German and the British Government , come back again in European institutions and that they are once again trying to European solutions and not solo efforts to find . 
we have all seen in this armed conflict : in the world , we are all nothing . we cannot have a contribution to peace in the world , when we act against . 
we need European mechanisms . 
what is proposed in this report , is a richtigerer step than the summit will shortly be discussed in Brussels . as meet only four Member States , but the same area , once again , the suspicion that it is more to do with a against other allies , which is designed political action . 
we also need Great Britain , with the table , because without Great Britain will not be able to this step . 
Madam President , I should first like to congratulate Mr Morillon , on his report , in the usual balanced way , vision and imagination realism and pragmatism . 
I would even wish him that even Mr Korakas , then it will perhaps it would in fact , a different opinion . 
the real question we face is , of course , provocative said , the European Union should be a Militärmacht ? 
I agree with the previous speaker , Mr Laschet right : we have in the last few weeks and months weltpolitisch as Europe , unfortunately , played no role . 
this is the fact . 
it is now , in particular , will , of course , always says , as Commissioner Patten . 
we are actually willing , a role to play ? 
I believe - and the report Morillon , which will be adopted by a large majority , shows that , in this House we wish to have a reasonable weltpolitische role to play . 
a military justification can help us ? 
I believe , yes , a military substantiating may help us , if there is a common foreign and security policy . 
they can the common foreign and security policy , but not replace can help and support them very well . 
now I am also sceptical about a arms race . 
it would be absurd to say , in fact , we have previously wettgerüstet , because it was a opponents , with which we have a strong . we must now arms race , because there is a partners , namely the United States of America , with which we must gleichrüsten . 
but - and we are right here - read the report Morillon says , primarily , but not exclusively , primarily , it is a question of our defence expenditure in such a way as to coordinate and coordinate so that we firstly with the same amount of a much greater effect , greater efficiency . 
secondly , surely it is also a question to see where are the gaps as Europeans we can finish . 
in fact , there are two alternative models : that it is , as it is for me , is no alternative . 
the alternative is that we as the United States will be a Militärmacht , just a little less strong , a little less imperialistisch , a little less effective . 
in my view , this is not acceptable . 
the other alternative is that we are working for a common foreign and security policy receive a military justification , as they Morillon expressed in his report , so that we are capable and efficiently , in the context of a multilateral policy to act . 
these are we not at present . 
the report by Mr Morillon , on how we could act in a multilateral framework efficiently . 
we therefore support the report , Mr Morillon loud and clear . 
Madam President , General Morillon has an interesting and credible report but , in some parts of the convention will certainly influence . 
the European defence industry is the key to the development of a common European defence policy , form part of the transatlantic cooperation must be . 
we must , therefore , a strong European defence industry , based on is and common competition , and should be developed . 
we should try to abolish any trade protectionism , also in the field of the arms trade , and the United States of completely opening up of their Waffenmarktes . 
the present system is ineffective and expensive . 
the taxpayers have the right to demand that each and every euro is used efficiently , which in turn , requires of us think European . 
a European Rüstungsagentur is therefore absolutely necessary . 
the European taxpayer really believe that it is out rationally and efficiently , the development of three ultramodernen to finance Kampfflugzeugen ? 
the European defence industry COs run the risk of sites to the Hochtechnologieforschung pure Montageanlagen . 
this would make Europe less dependent and . 
however , I cannot under any circumstances , we believe that , more without the United Kingdom . 
we should now move on to constructive part and focus on common definitions and methods . 
only with a larger budget for supplying arms and a on research and European defence industry within the framework of a common defence policy , we can a credible , more efficient and reliable partner of the United States . 
Madam President , I would like to my esteemed colleague congratulate General Morillon on his report . 
as my previous speakers have already said , it will have the right time . 
I am a strong supporter of the creation of a EU-Verteidigungspolitik , because I believe that this for a fundamental part of the European integration as the common currency . 
if , in addition , we learn from the debacle and want to draw the confusion , in which the European Union is at the moment , then the European Convention on the following Intergovernmental Conference and the arguments put forward in the heart of this report to take into account . 
I am a clear supporters of the transatlantic alliance between the EU and the United States , but not in its present form , if we are simply be expected , the foreign policy objectives of the United States to rubber-stamp , even if we do not agree with them . 
it must be a new balance on the basis of a real partnership will be created , in which the two sides of the drawing up the agreed political objectives are involved . 
however , we must recognise that we have any influence on the United States have , if we are in such a dependence on them . 
as General Morillon has pointed out , we must also share the burden . 
in addition , is that a EU-Verteidigungspolitik on a single common foreign and security policy must be based . 
I am not believe that our current differences of opinion on the occasion of our divided response to the crisis in Iraq to give the pessimism and Lähmungserscheinungen should be . 
if anything , it should be accrue from the political obligation to ensure that this will never happen again in the future . 
if we really our influence on the world stage , then we should want to make the EU-Staats- and Government , to some of the offices of the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations , zusammenzulegen , a single management by an adequate funding to set up and all our instruments in strategic sector - including trade , development , the environment , Justice and Home Affairs , on the use , in order to bring clear political objectives in the heart of our foreign policy to support it . 
it is to be hoped that we in our way of creating structures not the importance of conflict prevention and continuous investment in our Demokratisierungs- and disregard human rights strategy , because violations in these areas , in many parts of the world will lead to conflicts . 
Madam President , I would also like to support the excellent report by Mr Morillon , in great way and integrate Atlantiker Euro-Gaullisten . 
as someone who is a great deal of euro-gaullistischer than Mr Morillon , I would like to konzedieren that it is excellent , these two elements of European foreign and security policy to combine with each other . 
we can the European defence question so as not to discuss the question of whether we need a European Marmeladen-Richtlinie or not . 
it is merely the very raison d &apos;être of the gathering European unification . 
this is not only in this way , and , I can see that many of our citizens . this is shown by the surveys . 
the meaning of the European unification is peace and security , peace and security , both internally and externally . 
that is why it is high time that we make progress in the European foreign and security policy , and I am not so many misgivings as many other colleagues . 
it is true , our governments have made a jämmerliches picture . 
but if you look at the peoples of public opinion , so there is between peoples in the great basic issues - also in the Irak-Krieg - a much greater agreement as between the governments . 
I believe that we need instruments and institutions , the common will not only of the peoples &apos; , but also an active policy and , because it is not only the respective mood are lagging behind . 
we need a good , long-term strategy as the basis of a common foreign and security policy . 
I believe that the convention is the last opportunity , in the major Community of 15 - and soon the 25 or 30 - of a common foreign and security policy . 
I hope that it is able to do so . 
I will not Kern-Europa . 
I do not want to fragmentation of Europe . 
but if it in this wider circle not manage to make progress , then it must be a development towards a Kern-Europa . 
however , to a Kern-Europa , which is open to all those who are prepared to a common foreign and security policy . 
I would like to have a say quite clearly : I am of the opinion that we need both alliance . 
but even Franz-Josef Strauß , the late chairman of my party , said : &apos; that both alliance will only have a future , if it permanently on two equal strong pillars is built on an American pillar and on a European pillar . &apos; 
and that this European pillar does not exist , is not the fault of the Americans . 
it is our fault as Europeans . 
we will be after enlargement , which we have adopted today , more citizens have as Russia and the United States , and that is why it is high time that we do for our foreign and security policy , even spend more , the structures . 
not in the interests of a aggressive structure , but in terms of an active Friedenswahrung , as they are now so painfully is in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges have not been able , as they but the real task of the European Union is in 1952 since the founding of . 
Madam President , us by the Moderaten Sammlungspartei there is no need of the need for a common foreign and security policy . 
if the EU wants to exercise influence and its Member States must work together . 
it is the joint policy in particular , for the small countries in the EU is particularly important . 
unfortunately , the common foreign and security policy in the last few months in Scherben . 
we hope , however , that we are now that the people in the centre of Bagdads , on the case of Saddam jubeln and try to huge Standbild , can be umzustürzen , the European Union in the creation of this common policy on a . 
a few hours , most of us to a comprehensive enlargement of the European Union . 
this was probably the most important political decision which the majority of us has ever taken . 
many of the new Member States have to tackle their security question then a NATO membership high priority . 
after the days of the cold war , the NATO to a pan-European Sicherheitsorganisation developed . 
we should this fact in the development of the common security policy not disregard the Union . 
the common security policy of the EU must not , in contrast to the NATO . 
on the contrary , the cooperation must be further deepened . 
I hope that my own country , the same solution for his security policy , however , such as , for example , our Baltic neighbours , i.e. a membership of NATO . 
I see the aim of the European security policy is not in the first and foremost , the construction of a strong common Militärmacht .
