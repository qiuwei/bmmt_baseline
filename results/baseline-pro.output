the former fight of all the MEP from Greece and many of their comrades-in-arms has led to success . 
our the honourable Member and rapporteur , Mr Poos , has a significant contribution . 
in my opinion , it is encouraging that , at the end of this gap has been taken , the unpraktikablen amerikanisch-britischen plan . 
now , the free Republic of Cyprus as a member of the European Union the opportunity , with the Besatzermacht , Turkey and its local representative , Mr Denktash , a fair political solution to the Zypern-Frage to negotiate , a solution to the the overwhelming majority of the Turkish Cypriots , together with the Greek Cypriots sehnlichst hopes . 

the Republic of Cyprus is a completely confused legal situation , because the north of the island illegally occupied by Turkey . 
this occupation is in the rest of the United Nations , as well as the European Union has been condemned . 

nevertheless I believe that it was necessary to vote for the accession , because the Cypriots by means of a &apos; no &apos; vote twice punished would be : they are already occupied by the Turks and would then be rejected by the Union . 
in fact , would have a definitive conclusion with Turkey must be said , because it is the only thing they . 
it would be to clearly understand that they need to give its status as assoziierter partner of the European Union if they do not lose from the north of the island . 
I regret that we in the past was not the courage to do , but I hope that this will happen in the future . 


unfortunately , however , that is not the way that the Union train heading , because it is still a Schmusekurs by the prospect of Turkey , supporting the assistance doubled and this also as aid to Beitrittsvorbereitung einstuft . 
under these circumstances , we demand that before - I repeat , the opening of any accession negotiations with Turkey in all the countries of Europe referenda . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen . 
the Council has , in spite of the warnings and the Commission &apos; s Vorhaltungen during the negotiations - stressed a clear Rechtsbruch . 
with the controversial maintenance of the Annex XV in the accession treaty and the totally unilateral change to the financial framework of 2004-2006 , the Council has the interinstitutional agreement ( IIV ) between Parliament and the Council of 6 May 1999 broken . 
that is the Budgetrechte of Parliament are being trampled underfoot . 
it requires the same time , the European Parliament on an alternative either for his rights to fight or the Accession Treaties . 
with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries need to take this view of the ELDR Group , have their preparations in each country and must be examined individually . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , according to which the border of Cyprus , which will soon be a external borders of the Union and , hence , the Netherlands , will be sufficient . 
in addition , we are confident that the EU to find a solution to the Cyprus conflict . 
if we are in the vote on the accession of Cyprus have included , because we do not , then the Cypriot people have to be ashamed of anything at all . 
no , we , the leaders of the European Union its Unverantwortlichkeit . 
if we put a divided country whose existenzielles issue is resolved , in the European Union , although with regret , then this is an ( further ) signs to the inability of the Union as such , genuine political will to demonstrate . 
the accession of Cyprus into the Union , of course , would have to be dependent on its reunification . 
however , rather than this condition and the question of the accession of Cyprus to use as a lever , the European Union , to regret the fact that it is even a divided country . 
we think dare to dream great dreams ! 

this umpteenth wasted opportunity will have the result of a foreign power besetztes country in the Union , Turkey an additional and permanent means of blackmail towards the European Union in the will and the external borders of the Union de facto to the green line will set a limit - which neither the European Union parent or otherwise , apart from Turkey to be recognised . 


Mr President , this chapter 5 years was the our guiding principle of the Union : deepening before enlargement . 
the Heads of State and Government repeated in learned that the structures and the decision-making process of the Union of enlargement on 25 and more Members must be reformed . 
this should be done with the Treaty of Nice . 
but nothing has been dealt with this Treaty , but the decision-making process in the Council more complex . 
therefore , according to the need for the convening of a European convention , to a new Gründungsvertrag , to a European constitution . 
with the signing ceremony of the accession treaties on 16 April 2003 is being enlargement before the end of the work of the convention . 
it is a enlargement in the institutional confusion , all the more since the Irakkrise the süßen dreams , in the context of a common foreign and security policy has been made . 
Mr President , I voted for the inclusion of the Republic of Latvia in the European Union votiert . 
as a single representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party , Italy , in this House , I hope and wish that the Letten in the next European Parliament , which also about the Republic of Latvia extended , including a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party may choose , together with the other - as I very much hope many , Representative of the pensioners &apos; parties that exist in all Member States in 2004 , for the first time in the European Parliament will be able to help the interests of the elderly citizens . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen .

with the controversial maintenance of the Annex XV in the accession treaty and the totally unilateral change to the financial framework of 2004-2006 , the Council has the interinstitutional agreement ( IIV ) between Parliament and the Council of 6 May 1999 broken .

with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries need to take this view of the ELDR Group , have their preparations in each country and must be examined individually . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria , no doubt that the from the European Parliament on many occasions . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , that even the countries in which he even the most deficits , including Latvia , at the time of their accession will be sufficient to meet the Copenhagen criteria . 
the warnings of Commissioner Verheugen to some candidate countries , the decision of the Commission , six months before the accession of a Comprehensive monitoring Report , to publish by the ELDR Group proposed peer review of the new and old Member States in the field of human rights , corruption , administrative capacity and independent financial control ( Amendment No Malmström / Maaten ) , the for the Commission , the possibility of a few years direct measures against the internal market , to take ( the Garantieklauseln ) , and the own-initiative report , Mr Mulder , on the reform of the approval of the expenditure are therefore of crucial importance . 
Mr President , this chapter 6 I am not one of those who Poland and other countries , that they want to abstrafen in favour of the Atlantic solidarity of the European solidarity have preferred . 
every state , each government has the right to support the Kriegspolitik Bush or not . 
but it is clear that the majority of the new members of the Union an American Alliance and the NATO a broader European integration . 
the representatives of the British government in the convention their pleasure to bring about this development . 
in an interview with The Times made Peter Hain clearly that he was in an alliance with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe against any shift towards a European superstate . 
the United Kingdom and others will therefore not hesitate to the Intergovernmental Conference , which the results of the convention to confirm their right of veto . 
this veto could , any intention to qualified majority decision-making in areas such as the common foreign and security policy , the budgetary and fiscal policy , the economic and social policy . 
the use of the word &apos; federal &apos; will be verfehmt . 
an appeal to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in judicial decisions for individuals will not be possible . 
Mr President , today , on 9 April 2003 , I voted for the inclusion of Lithuania in the European Union . 
I also hope to the inclusion of a representative of the Lithuanian Pensioners &apos; Party in the European Parliament to support in the defence of the rights of all the elderly throughout Europe .

it requires the same time , the European Parliament on alternative , either for his rights to fight or the Accession Treaties . 
with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
Mr President , I shall now turn to my last chapter . 
in view of the institutional Nebels that I have just have the enlarged European Union will be forced to confine myself to a single market . 
it will , in order to a Freihandelsassoziation , as far as possible , still on the other side of the Atlantic . 
it is interesting that the most supporter of this rash enlargement from the ranks of the former EFTA-Mitglieder . 
since I do not want the enlarged European Union , on a large market abgesegneten Washington the rich countries , remains for me , as is nothing more than before reluctantly consenting to decide on the votes on the accession of all the new Member States of the vote , which I am very happy to welcome but nonetheless . 

Mr President , I voted for Hungary &apos; s accession to the European Union . 
since , in the enlarged Europe at least 200 million pensioners will live , I hope that the introduction Hungary &apos; s own representatives in the European Parliament , will allow us to make a proper balance between the number of Members and the number of pensioners in Europe . 
I therefore hope that the Hungarian pensioners a representatives in this Parliament to send so that the interests of the elderly throughout Europe more effectively and with more force may be defended .

. 
I voted today against the request of the Republic of Malta for inclusion in the European Union . 
reason for my decision is the detention of Malta to the Zugvogeljagd . 
Malta had in the accession negotiations strictly refused , the during the European Union ( EU-Vogelschutzrichtline ) in full , and has achieved a transitional period that has been established , the Malta Vogeljagd until the end of 2008 . 
this regulation is a blank cheque for Wilderer and illegal those who sell them . 
hunt High Sea , Singvogeljagd with Schlagnetzen and the mass Abschuss seltenster Singvögel are , after European Rechtsvorstellungen strictly prohibited . 
a Beitrittsbewerber must recognise this legal basis . 
Mr President . 
it was a difficult decision , against the accession of a country to vote in favour , for which I have a very great deal of respect for these serious Gewissensentscheidung . I have , for me alone . 
I have tried to influence neither my group , I have influence of it . 
I can add my voice is not a candidate country , the actively with take troops in a illegal unmoralischen and dirty war in Iraq , by making Völkerrechtsbruch without any hesitation , and the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians supports . 
Poland is on the wrong way and his government , but not only . 
the Polish people have preferred to see the American Kriegsminister instead of the Polish Pope . 
the Poland are stolzer on their Spezialeinheit GROM than on their Catholic Bischöfe for peace . 
to conclude that they themselves from the community of values in the EU . 
I hope that it will soon be back . 
today , after careful thought and in complete agreement with my conscience , I have to vote voted &quot; no &quot; . 
Mr President , I also hope that in Poland , I voted for accession - a representative or a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the next European Parliament and in this House to support so that I will be more force for our common defence MEP all elderly people throughout Europe . 
there are two reasons for my symbolic vote against the accession of Poland . 
the first reason is in the so-called &apos; ethical declaration &apos; , which has been added to the accession Treaties and the position against abortion covers situation and . 
the second reason is the involvement of Polish soldiers on Irak-Krieg , in a demonstration servilen Pro-Amerikanismus and a very vermessenen anti-European position . 
I think that I therefore for the hopes and wishes of the proud Polish people , that as an independent country and a member of the European Union to conclude a period in which this great , historic country has been used as a satellite , for the time of the United States and before from Russia and Germany . 
we support the right of Poland , as well as all the other candidate countries to join the European Union . 
but this country has saddled conditions make it clear , as are the accession treaty . 
Poland has , for example , is not entitled to the same subsidies , such as the countries of the current European Union , although the farmers a large part of its population . 
however , the European institutions to subsidise their capitalist agriculture , so that they abwirft profits , as the poor farmers to help of the countries of their work to be able to live . 
furthermore , the Polish workers , despite all the legal Kopfstände seven years to wait before they come and work in the Union . 
it is also unacceptable that the Union , which is demanding that , if the working classes are to be expected of the victims of this country , the Polish Church readily concessions . 
the European Union , not only accepts the freedom of women beeinträchtigende Abtreibungsverbot , of all , that the relevant Polish legislation can be changed by Community law , and so that the Polish women in the cold , under the thumb of a particularly reactionary Church ! 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen .

it requires the same time , the European Parliament on alternative , either for his rights to fight or the Accession Treaties . 
with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
. 
I will justify my &apos; no &apos; to the accession of the Republic of Poland , at the moment , to the European Union , so that Poland was the only one candidate country actively with Elitesoldaten in a völkerrechtswidrigen war , at the moment is taking place in Iraq . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries need to take this view of the ELDR Group , have their preparations in each country and must be examined individually . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria , no doubt that the from the European Parliament on many occasions . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , that even the countries in which he even the most deficits , including Poland , at the time of their accession will be sufficient to meet the Copenhagen criteria .

Mr President , bearing in mind that , in Slovenia already a Pensioners &apos; Party , on behalf of the DeSUS - which , in the government of the country is involved , I hope that your wish . I hope that it is a own representatives in this Parliament can send , so that the pensioners not only Slovenia , but all the countries of the new , from the EP-Wahlen produced in 2004 Europe on a massive presence of supporters of the interests of older people can support from the pensioners &apos; parties that exist all these countries , including Slovenia , come .

- ( NL ) As a member of the delegation for relations with the Slovakia , I know about the problems of this country about more than on the other candidate countries . 
I note that unsustainable political parties and that the economy , with the result is collapsed a massive unemployment in the East and that the successive governments are not prepared to the families of national minorities earlier angetanes or injustice . 
the re-division in provinces of the fact is that , on the southern edge of Slovakia ungarisch discussed and the vast majority of the local population that ungarisch administration and education . 
the majority of members of the Roma-Bevölkerungsgruppe occupied villages in the East is still considered to be managed by a Slovak elite , the a Alleinanspruch on Straßenbeleuchtungen Wasserwerke , to have and gardens . 
perhaps , many people from of Slovakia for , in the neighbouring Vienna work . 
with the inclusion of Slovakia , the EU imported the environmental problems of the nuclear power stations and of the Donau-Staudamms . 
the accession is , however , in the internally divided Slovakia much less controversial than in the neighbouring countries Poland and the Czech Republic , in which the majority will soon be included in the context of a referendum possibly will vote against it . 
various groups who would like to see this accession improvements . 
on 5 September 2001 , I fear , that they will be disappointed , but I respect your decision . 

once again is the vote on the calendar of the European Parliament in 2004 , has been used by the Straßburg-Gegnern Anwesenheitszeit in order to reduce in this city . 
and as the last time this vote is contrary to the Treaty , because of the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions is that 12 sittings in Strasbourg . 
a reduction on 11 meetings in Wahljahren traditionellerweise is permitted . 
but this time , the anti-Strasbourg actually went even further , they will only 10 meetings . 
this result is as a absurd machinations of the Party of European Socialists , to remove the last April , so as not to have to work on 1 May . 
there is still blatant violation of that , if we adopted the calendar for 2004 the implementation of 5 Minitagungen in Brussels , which can be accepted only in theory , if the 12 normal plenary part-session in Strasbourg . 
we call on the French Government , the Court of Justice oppose this illegal vote , because the European Parliament is not a sovereign representatives of the people , but has only on the him with the Treaty and has special powers of the Treaty . 


in view of the special importance of 1 May as Internationaler day of the workers for us , it is not in question , in this day to appear in the European Parliament . 
the rest of the timetable , which affects us , and we have no special position on this . 
in accordance with their political line , and the UEN Group is opposed this year each manoeuvres , with the the long run , or the number of the plenary part-session in Strasbourg should be reduced . 
in the last few years various lobby groups are always tried , through a variety of activities of the final transfer of the headquarters of the Parliament of Strasbourg to Brussels achieve - I am thinking particularly of the reduction in the plenary part-session to four days or the increase in the extraordinary meetings in Brussels - penetrates into the UEN Group , on compliance with the Treaties spirit and letter in which the implementation of 12 meetings per year in Strasbourg . 


it is customary in Wahljahren a part-session in Strasbourg on Fridays , but , at the same time , we must astonished to note that the number of extraordinary meetings remains unchanged . 
this situation is completely anormal for 2004 , and I have proposed two additional meetings , in order to remove the zwölfte in accordance with the legislation again Strasbourg part-session . 
it is obvious that so that everyone its responsibility . 
for us things are clear : for Strasbourg must not to the rank of a simple Außenstelle from Brussels herabgestuft ; it is and must the headquarters of the European Parliament . 
with its vote on the calendar for 2004 , our House just ten part-sessions in Strasbourg . 
in the Treaties and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is , however , make it clear that the calendar of part-sessions of Parliament annually twelve or in Wahljahren eleven plenary part-session in Strasbourg , before must have the inclusion of additional Minisitzungen in Brussels can be considered . 

therefore , is missing in the for the election year 2004 calendar adopted a Strasbourg part-session , not to mention the absurdity of a votes on an anonymous basis , with the the very day that the European Parliament , the accession Treaties of the new Member States , the Strasbourg part-session , on the original deletion of the Members of the Member States should be welcomed . 
in view of the fact that the result of the European Parliament as an unlawful one , the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group , President Pat Cox that the relevant conclusions and the outcome of altogether . 
it calls for the urgent convening of the Conference of Presidents as quickly as possible , in order to a new , with the law konforme vote to be added . 
. ( DA ) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report , because we believe that it is necessary to guarantee a fair treatment of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the country . 
however , we are in principle the opinion that these rights are the best way of the national legislation of the Member States to be regulated , the from it , but a democratic legitimacy . 
we are also aware that the proposal for a field is concerned , the Title IV of the Treaty Establishing and does not apply to Denmark , cf. the protocol on the position of Denmark . 

in spite of the votes against the MPF-Abgeordneten and also of such a large part of the rights of the European Parliament has just the report Cerdeira Morterero , the directive proposed by the Commission on the family reunification and many erweiternde proposes changes . 
with these amendments , in particular , the definition of the families of the family reunification , can make use , the possibility of this right from the applicant speeded up and the Ablehnungsmöglichkeiten for the Member States . 
from our point of view , the original Commission proposal was already very bad , both his principle and in his procedures . 
the result of this vote should opening the eyes of the Council . 
even if it is not the amendments of the European Parliament to be taken into account ( because this is simply being consulted on this issue ) , should be clear to the Council if it is the principle of a system of family reunification at European level , it has accepted a dangerous mechanism in order . 
it is obvious that the Commission and its allies in future with their common thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism and its lack of wirklichem sense of the European interests constantly to the constant enlargement for this so-called law . 
we are , of course , against the polygamy and the repression of the for women . 
we accept , however , that under the pretext that one of the wives already living in the host country , the other entry and residence be denied . 
under the pretext of moral principles is merely another obstacle to the immigration and personal links . 
although we reject such a limit in principle , we have voted for the amendment , the derogations at least in the case , if the Kindeswohl this requires . 

furthermore , the amendments we have with demütigendem nature , such as the use of DNA-Tests against the immigrants or the argument of public health , which is based on the selfish attitude , medical aid , the European countries can provide , to refuse people do not have access to the otherwise . 
once again , the proposals , the clear progress , not binding , and the report as a whole does not help to the national legislation upwards , but downwards each other . 
. ( DA ) We have decided to us to our group , and for the motion for a resolution in the report Morterero to vote in favour of it . 
but we are aware that the resolution circumstances is concerned , the Title IV of the EC Treaty and therefore not be subject to apply to Denmark , cf. the protocol on the position of Denmark . 
. ( PT ) We are all aware of the gulf between the Tampere Summit statements and the content of this proposal for a directive , aware of the us now , after more than three-year advice in the Council and two amendments to the original proposal , the Commission . 
it was stated that a policy of integration should be aimed at granting rights and duties of immigrants , which are comparable with those of the European citizens . 
this text is in the opposite direction . 
as a result of differences of opinion in the Council is in line with this proposal Community standards , the &apos; bottom-up &apos; to the lowest common denominator ones , and , with a reduzierenden exposition of the concept of &apos; relatives and many derogations , so that some of the central points remain unresolved . 
that is why we support the proposals in this report , the concept of &apos; members &apos; wishes , the principle of non-discrimination and the lifting günstigerer legislation . 
on our initiative , the report now provisions , the examination of applications , not the administrations , in addition to its normal workload impose and the subjective concept of a long-term relationship . 
it should be excluded from the incidence of illness or disabilities according to the issue of the residential status as a justification for the refusal of a renewal of residence . 
with the introduction of the quality of the report contrasts amendments from the original proposal and therefore deserves our support . 
I would like to my colleague , as I have a member of the intergroup &apos; anti-racism &apos; is , for her work on the important and difficult issue of family reunification . 
I voted in favour of this report and I support it in the light of my previous work in the field of immigration , I am , in particular , with secondary migration issues . these include , amongst other things , for the provisions in the United Kingdom , after which Ehepaare of different nationalities must prove that the main purpose of the Eheschließung is not the immigration . 
it is important that the Member States of the entry of close relatives as parents and Ehe- Lebenspartnern or , if this is not for their own living . 
the implementation of the directive must not lead to the current level of protection granted by the various Member States . 
. 
( PT ) The immigration is a serious problem , the a realistic and responsible reaction from the Community institutions . 
if no appropriate and balanced measures be taken in this area , then it is precisely the harmful effects , which all European citizens . 
the least during these serious and is now widely recognised problems must be done , it is not to further deteriorate . 
as Commissioner António Vitorino said quite clearly , should be noted that the absorption capacity of the European cities borders . 
we can , of course , the issue of immigration cannot solve that caused the right to family reunification . 
I think that is quite clear , because I do not deny the importance of this approach . 
but we can and must be the right to family reunification only serious , without its raison d &apos; être . 
in the report and in the resolution on this directive has been a different approach in which this right irrationally subsidised on personal circumstances which has been extended no family relations . 
this linksgerichtete irresponsibility of serves only to the resistance against distrust and a natural fundamental right . 
for all these reasons , I am obliged , to vote against the report . 
that concludes voting time . our 
( the sitting was suspended at 14.15 p.m. p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. ) 
the next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0111 / 2003 ) by Mr Morillon , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur - priorities and weaknesses . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as we six months ago in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , our Parliament with the work on this report , we ahnten begun , not that it is in such a tragic and distressing time would be submitted . 
the aim was the updating of the previous report by our colleague Mrs Catherine Lalumière , the necessary , because the events of September 2001 should be taken into account and a contribution to the work of our fellow Members wanted to make the convention . 
a some European security and Verteidigungsstruktur at a time to assess fear because , after all , it is at least temporarily quite breakdown , as the fact that it may seem . 
my fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , as they were of a different opinion on 25 March this year , in the middle of the crisis , the report adopted tomorrow , to the vote in Parliament . 
there are , in my view , at least three reasons . 
firstly , we have a responsibility to our electorate . 
the second is in the knowledge that the current crisis us on the eve of enlargement as a lesson we must serve . 
the third reason is , in our intention to a clarification of the policy of the transatlantic cooperation , which the Member States want to take it appears that , with many of us in the hope that the current differences of opinion , seem more serious than they are . 
the first reason , the responsibility to our electorate . 
for all of us Eurobarometerumfragen known for years , it is clear that a majority of two thirds of the European citizens a common security and defence policy . 
as our fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , this mood are aware , it was only natural that they should be in a similar percentage share . 
this was , at least in the case of the vote in committee , the after a full debate took place in the question of almost 200 amendments . 
in our new Rules of Procedure , would be a simple vote in Parliament have been possible , but in view of the importance of this issue we were unanimous agreement of the opinion that the current debate is justified , in which we are also the Council and the Commission wanted to . 
in this debate , we identified great value , in order - and this is my second point - without further delay learn the lessons of the current crisis . 
Europe was not in the situation , in the United Nations Security Council to speak with one voice , such as this according to the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty would have been his duty . 
this is not proof , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that it is now time to change our institutions , in future the confusion and to prevent the Kakophonie , who are beginning to - but , as I hope only temporarily - in the coexistence of the Member States have made a ? 
as you know , the citizens expect , as I have already said , but perhaps more the whole world , that Europe its place in the construction of a multipolar political world , in order to prevent the fate of the planet , still only to be borne by the President of the United States . 
I now come to my third and most important point . 
Europe is prepared to take responsibility , as it is expected of it ? 
I am not sure . 
the decision before us today is that it is in any case clearer than ever before . 
either the Member States , such as in the cold war they continue to defend the forces of the United States alone . 
in this case , the Americans can hardly lessons , such as Washington intends to these armed forces . 
or but they accept what the United States have always of them , i.e. the burden to share , which is , of course , a greater contribution to the joint efforts . 
NATO Secretary-General , Lord Robertson recently referred in your presence , Commissioner Patten , on the gap between the governments of Europe declared ambition and the resources , they are prepared for their implementation . 
he described this as the gap of ambition . 
I hope that the current crisis to help them to make this gulf aware and , with their eradication . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament , the recent crisis in Iraq has quite made it clear , where in Europe , which is , in particular , for the area of foreign affairs and defence . 
let us not , however , in the weaknesses of Europe . 
this crisis can also be a creative effect on the European policies , and that is why , in my view , the report Morillon very timely , even if this still do not show up its time . 
in today &apos; s time , we must , as the old system of the existence of two superpowers has collapsed , new security policy strategies and measures . 
in view of this fact , the dissemination of weapons of mass destruction is not the only Krisenherd . 
this is not the only risk , through the global security and stability are being threatened . 
grassierende poverty , organised crime , institutionalised violence and serious economic crises can also harmful to the global stability and security effect as military or terrorist activities . 
of course we have to look at the same time , to what extent and at what stage we in the light of this dangers the right political measures . 
in addition to all of us elected response , we believe that it is absolutely essential that the global security on mutual trust , cooperation and the consensus in international organisations , pushing and networks . 
the method that we have with threats to global security , will govern our future , if we are building peace and a healthy economic environment ensure and convincing answers to global political , economic and ecological problems . 
I would like to take the opportunity , with a view to the Irak-Krise , I am delighted that the extremely interesting report by General Morillon the Presidency has given the opportunity of the views of the Council to a for European integration subject as important as the European security and defence policy , is to say . 
both the report , Mr Morillon , as well as other relevant initiatives , as the report , Mr Barnier , have valuable ideas offered us , particularly in the for the Intergovernmental Conference planned debate , but also at the moment , can be of use , since the competent authorities of the Council &apos; s draft documents which the integration of the ESVP-Mechanismus . this applies also , of course , for the convention . 
I should like to point out here , and I declare the same why that some ideas formulated in the report , Mr Morillon , initiatives already on the way and have been expressed by the competent bodies of the Union . 
I will in the debate with the current threats to safety , stability and peace , to start by different than that from threats are familiar with the past . 
the ESVP-Mechanismus was , in order to tell the truth , not from the outset , horizontal and irrational threats , such as the terrorism and the dissemination of weapons of mass destruction , that is why the mechanism careful and gradually to the current security environment must be adapted . 
consequently , were the first steps to establish concrete objectives : the use of the forces of the Union for the protection against terrorist attacks on the civilian population , on the one hand , and their use in war zones , on the other . 
there is no doubt that the development and the improvement of the military capabilities of the pivotal and central point of safety , and therefore also of the defence of the Union . 
we devote special attention to this issue and , in the framework of the continuation of the so far , efforts is planned , a conference on the ability to convene in implementing the appropriate action plan , the ECAP to assess the progress made , and to note and in order to decide what should be moved forward . 
the presidency has produced a text contains the guidelines , according to the conclusion of the work of the relevant working groups , the ECAP-Panels , to do . 
we hope that these initiatives , a new impulse our operational capacity in the military sector to improve and to help in addition , that the foundations for the further development of ESDP . 
in this respect , it is of particular importance to build the rapid reaction force , which is why this subject of the Spanish Presidency in the priorities in the field of the military aspect of the ESDP . 
the operational framework of the establishment and action of the rapid reaction force will be determined by the competent political and military authorities , were reviewed , and we do any effort so that it until the end of the Greek presidency to complete . 
it goes without saying that the strengthening of the military capabilities of the Union will only be possible if we and our cooperation in the Rüstungsbereich . 
this project should be planned , of course , already before , but now is the time , it is implemented , and the European Union sets foot in new to this . 
the decision of the European Council is in two parts : firstly , the Council , the role of the Verteidigungsforschung and the development of the relevant capabilities of the Union in a more general framework to be monitored and , secondly , the possibility of setting up a European Rüstungsagentur , an intergovernmental European authority to investigate . 
these two projects are important steps towards strengthening cooperation on defence . 
the Verteidigungsforschung can , in future , with the policies of the European Union in terms of competitiveness be associated with many sectors , in order to provide advice and whose development forward as well as greater enlargement . 
with the same intention is also the development of a comprehensive Weltraumpolitik of the Union , which is to be implemented in the Sicherheitssektor , which also in the report Morillon has been raised . 
the developments in the last decade , makes it clear that there are many joint risks , and we need a coordinated joint response . 
for this reason , it is necessary to have a common information system security policy and to promote , and , therefore , the creation of a system of common political and military training for crisis management for the Presidency is of interest , and we have been working . 
the report Morillon said idea of a civil peace corps , is a very good idea , especially as this will help to make aware of the European average citizen , what is happening in the Sicherheitssektor and how we deal to practical level , and we have to take part in this . 
we consider this idea carefully , and the presidency will most likely a draft with the relevant guidelines . 
a basic element of European security is certainly the relationship between the Union to NATO . 
the European option in crisis management is in any case , first of all , to the will and the Handlungsbereitschaft the regional and international organisations to call , in other words , the dialogue has priority . 
the recent agreement on cooperation between the European Union and NATO is an important step towards mutual complement and support of the two organisations . 
I would like to use this opportunity to say , in the report by Mr Morillon , to emphasise that the activities of the two organisations and of its members of the principles of the United Nations Charter determined and must be done . 
ladies and gentlemen , as I have already said , these points , both in the report , Mr Morillon , and in the objectives of the Presidency , and that is why we are trying to it . 
however , there is no doubt that the report covers a wide range of ideas , the very important questions and institutional aspects of the ESDP , so that a remarkable contribution to our debate . 
I do not intend to dwell on each of these in the report containing ideas , despite the fact that many of them very interesting . for the implementation of these ideas , institutional reforms , which is currently in the context of the convention and then discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference to be addressed . 
I am sure , however , that they as valuable source of inspiration and consideration will be of benefit . 
we are in a decisive turning point . 
the reduce Union has the courageous companies in the enlargement and must , therefore , with a firm step for an extension of its policies , so that they ensure on the basis of other factors than in the past , can go to the other way . 
the overwhelming majority of the Europeans expects this , as Mr Morillon in his report . 
the time actually require Entschlussfähigkeit and Handlungswillen , the aim of this is , at the end of the defence identity of the European Union . 
this will allow the European Union to strengthen their safety and their foreign policy . 
ladies and gentlemen , the current situation could , in spite of the dark side , the start of a intensive discussion , what the European Union will from now on , especially now that we in the middle of an open debate on the future of Europe . 
these questions are still not been clarified , and what lessons we also from the reasons and the development of the Irak-Krise , we must draw scenario , so that we in the future and prefer to avoid similar situation and Europe in the global system can give greater weight . 
Mr President , I would like to start by General Morillon very warmly on his comprehensive - and in any case highly topical - contribution to the debate on the development of the European security and defence policy . 
on the topical , both my and honourable friend as the Minister of the Council Presidency rightly pointed out . 
the number of amendments , with which the Committee before the adoption of this resolution has done , is of great interest in many respects , frankly but also the different views on this Schlüsselbereichs of Europe . 
in my own answer , I am the current competences of the Commission in security and defence issues . 
I will certainly take account of them , and I do not do this , then I will remind Mr Van Orden to them . 
irrespective of what future recommendations of the convention , in my colleague , Commissioner Barnier the talks on defence issues informed has done - and I know that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , in the course of the discussion on this report has informed - the competences of the Commission is currently in relation to the many in this text subjects dealt with very limited . 
the Commission is not at purely military aspects of the European security and defence policy . 
this is only the Member States . 
that is why I will not on the specific military proposals , such as the setting up constantly einsatzbereiter forces , the inclusion of a clause to the collective defence or the creation of a common Militärakademie . 
in the Treaty , the Commission will , however , with the ESDP in connection with this - Article 27 contains a clear reference - and we are actively involved in all the discussions on operations of crisis management in the context of the ESDP , particularly as regards the instruments for civil conflict management , for example , policing , strengthening the rule of law and civil administration and civil protection . 
in this context , I am pleased to say that the resolution we have before us sends the importance of civil and military contributions to crisis management . 
however , it is not possible - and this point on various occasions , I have raised in this House - purely military aspects of the problems that are associated with that , on , for which we in the Commission is responsible and which we have a real contribution to make . 
military and non-military aspects are not clean in different any dissociate . 
and they should it , because they have in the service of an overall strategy closely linked to be coordinated . 
the Commission can , for example , the support of the police forces in the wake of conflicts , such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the European Union on 1 January the police mission has adopted by the UN ; or we could look at the training of Grenzschützern in regions , which uncontrolled Massenmigration ; we can lead to conflicts , as in the past , in the Balkans and topical in Afghanistan , the reconstruction of administrative structures in countries which have behind a conflict . 
the Commission has already have a lot of choice of instruments and Fachkenntnissen , which can be used in crisis situations . 
as General Morillon , could new instruments of the European Union in the security as necessary . 
but the most important condition is that all available instruments in any situation for the implementation agreed political objectives of the European Union should be used . 
I must say that the current events show that this is not the case for a long time . 
another area in which the Commission must take a very important role , relates to the strategy for Rüstungsfragen . 
I believe that we can and should Rüstungshandel and -produktion within the internal market is not a &apos; , closed Jagdgründe &apos; . 
the procurement of Wehrtechnik , the competition between Rüstungsfirmen , research and development , education , training and imports of Verteidigungsgütern aspects of the Rüstungshandels , talking about dual-use goods and , on a civilian and military benefits have , these are all areas in which the advantages of the internal market for the European industry are important . 
this is still very can be improved . 
the Commission has recently adopted a communication to the Council and Parliament for Verteidigungsgüterindustrie , in the it refers to a number of areas in which fundamental progress made possible by the taxpayers in the European Union a greater added value for their in the safety of that money . 
the concerns about a Duplizierung and fragmentation of the production and procurement arms and a lack of interoperability - in the next resolution will be raised - some of the key issues to which we wanted to go in our communication . 
our hope is that we with our on the communication can help follow-up embarked upon a strong and competitive defence industry , transparent market conditions and a climate is conducive to investment in the for a strengthening of the ESDP necessary research and development projects . 
in the final analysis , the credibility of the common foreign and security policy in large part of the military capacity of the European Union . 
the creation of a 60 000 men strong &apos; Rapid Reaction Force &apos; in the context of the ESDP will certainly to strengthen the European credibility abroad . 
in addition , the adoption of the first Militäroperation of the European Union in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last month , that the ESDP , not only in a theoretical construction . 
however , I agree with my friend General Morillon entirely that our allies still difficult , Europe seriously , if we do not invest more in our security . 
the argument that Europe have its share of the costs it by a large proportion of the world of development aid - even if this is , of course , is true - or by the humanitarian aid aufstockt even further , is not enough . 
we must also more in the development of our spheres of operation in the form of Lufttransportkapazitäten , special teams and Gefechtskommunikationstechnik . 
if we do not do this , then we will continue to our allies of the opinion that Europe his Friedensdividende after the fall of the Berlin wall to make has quickly . 
the main task of aid organisations should still in the provision of aid , the neutrality , independence and impartiality such humanitarian operations . 
a respect for these principles is for the satisfaction of humanitarian needs in essential . 
for this reason , the Commission welcomes the fact that the report on the guidelines for the deployment of military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten within the framework of humanitarian UN-Operationen in complex emergencies , on 20 March 2003 were published by the UN . 
it is clear rules on the relationship between military and humanitarian operators in humanitarian UN-Operationen . 
the Hauptaussagen the guidelines for the use of European military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten in humanitarian operations . 
I would like to make one last comment about the humanitarian law , the military action to apply . 
we believe that the humanitarian law for the conflicts in the present time , provided that the Kriegsparteien and all the signatories of the Geneva Convention , to their obligations . 
I should like at this stage to the recognition of the Commission with regard to the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross as subsidiary parties and guardians of the Convention . 
finally , I would like to my honourable friend say once more that this report to almost painful way is topical . 
it raises a number of issues , which are directly on our credibility in Europe , and if we take the effort in the coming years , a greater contribution in international affairs . but , as I have already said on previous occasions in this House have said , a moment in the policy in which we implement its will . 
in relation to security this time we have already been long exceeded . 
Mr President , in the wake of Commissioner Patten , I should like to say that the report of Mr Morillon , in fact , will be presented at exactly the right time . 
in the last few weeks was presented to us is the de facto powerlessness of the European Union and the individual Member States to work together in the field of defence a much role to play . 
the criticism of the United States , America should not as Weltpolizist , is in fact of the strange that the itself in a position to do so and , in fact , often are not prepared . 
at the time , we have , in particular , the experience in Yugoslavia , where the European countries not from &apos; Friedfertigkeit &apos; and &apos; modesty &apos; they commented publicly , but from &apos; cynicism &apos; and &apos; indifference &apos; . 
this hypocrisy is gradually from this Parliament have disappeared . 
we all have clearly recognised in my opinion , that Europe responsibility in the defence cultures , and this - in what form - has said . 
it is to be hoped that it actually happen . 
only on the organisations of the European Union and in cooperation with the transatlantic partners , it is possible to fulfil this task . 
these two must always be mentioned in a breath . 
they are closely linked component . 
the stronger the transatlantic trust , the greater the internal the unity of the European Union . 
in this area in which the European Union , i.e. often stirring up trouble depends on it with our attitude to the United States , our transatlantic partner , together . 
this is the combination of these two a very important element , also in the report by General Morillon . 
it is a realistic way to a European Verteidigungsverantwortung , because of its experience as General knows that military actions , always in the first and then buried as they are necessary civil actions . 
in view of the now raubend and plündernd by the roads Bagdads ziehenden Mobs is fully aware of this . 
in addition to a successful concluded action must therefore be intervention immediately to civil level . 
the decision on such a cautious , realistic way is , for example , by common research and development , by means of a common definition of the from a European perspective existing military needs . 
this is , of course , always a new departure , and in many countries , it will be difficult for us to move on , but it is of the utmost importance . 
for the production , this is extremely important . 
this is the effectiveness of the Verteidigungsanstrengungen be strengthened considerably . 
if the search for a European point of view of the responsibility which we in the field of defence , our starting point , can also be gained the confidence of all the Member States . 
no one is in order to respond to the question of how great country that this should be nachgefolgt : France , Germany , Great Britain , and the United States . 
it is essential that we in the European Union a common European position in Militärangelegenheiten . 
in addition the report by Mr Morillon a unmissverständlicher impulse . 
he acted so that , in fact , a already by Commissioner Patten surgical method , namely the borders of the us by the Treaties already opportunities to capital . 
this will be carried out a thorough examination and it is a brick wall at some point , then , to which we know how a reform must be and what institutional changes to decide . 
I personally believe that this has always been for a very practical way , and General Morillon has also decided . 
for a European Verteidigungsverantwortung are the prospects for , of course , still not particularly helpful . 
the developments , which we have seen recently , have shown that the Member States and the members of the Council itself not even a serious idea of the Council . 
otherwise , would , for example , the Greek presidency currently initiatives taken in this area in a much greater role to play . 
we must not to the possibility of a Auseinanderfallens of the European Union in two groups , each with a closer cooperation . 
in short , it is incredibly important that the European defence at the request of the citizens , as well as General Morillon lays down that reality . 
this will allow a more efficient use of the budget , and this is directly to all citizens . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , two years after the report , which I had the honour of our House at the same subject , I should like to present today with pleasure my full support for the report by Mr Morillon . 
after the adoption , as we hope , some of our group has tabled amendments to the adoption of the motion for a resolution well without difficulties to be arranged . 
I shall therefore limit myself to a number of points , which is in the context of this very turbulent spring 2003 particularly important . 
in this context is not good for the fledgling European Security and Defence Policy , the ESDP . 
since 11 September 2001 is the European Union in political and military terms , being sidelined to a large extent , be it in the Afghanistan- or the Irakfrage or with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
our presence is not to zero decreased , but it is in civil and humanitarian actions . 
this is important , but it is not enough . 
far worse , however , is that in this period within the Union . 
despite the commendable efforts of the Greek Presidency , the adoption of common positions , to be shared the opinions in the Irakfrage , both in terms of the kind of our transatlantic relations and our Grades to autonomy , with regard to the United States , as a corollary - in terms of certain principles as the use of violence , the importance of international law or the role of the United Nations . 
but despite this dark situation loudly and clearly , I would like to express my conviction that we must give under any circumstances . 
some countries - Germany , France , Belgium and Luxembourg , have already started an initiative which , in order to relaunch security and defence policy . 
Greece , which holds the Unionsvorsitz has responded positively , as the Prime Minister Simitis stated recently . 
I hope that the convention , with its chairman Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing after a few weeks of secrecy and hesitation in this issue , too , proposals . 
excellent ideas on the institutions of the foreign , security and defence policy are already by Mr Dehaene and Mr Barnier has , moreover , with the views expressed by Parliament . 
today , the report , Mr Morillon , a whole range of interesting proposals , for example , to the objectives of the CFSP and the ESDP under the new international conditions on the new role of NATO , the relations between the European Union and NATO , the military capacity high-tech patenting activity , in particular , which we simply need to be credible . 
of course , it is not a question of compete with the United States . 
that would be completely unwise and impossible . 
rather , it is a question of certain , in fact , simple situation to be taken into account . 
because of its geographical proximity and its common borders are the countries of Europe together in the security . 
because of its traditions , particularly in cultural point of view , they have important values and principles in the world . 
and finally , the Europeans are due to their resources and the economic policy instruments which they have created in the situation , their ideas to spread and their interests , if necessary , throughout the world to defend themselves when they only the will of this . 
in short , the Europeans have quite simply a role to play in the world , without this , but we also want to dominate without any subordination and without a whatever sort of Untertänigkeitsverhältnis . 
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , do you ! 
this is in line with the wishes of Parliament , which will support you . 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Morillon regrets that I in his opening of the debate . 
this report could not be more topical . 
if , as this is probably - the American and British forces now have the control of Baghdad , then the debate on the effects of war and to ziehenden lessons from the start . 
in contrast to its predecessors shows the current administration only low level of interest in a strong and unified Europe . 
our weakness is bloßgelegt cruelly , and it is the duty of the EU to develop a Sicherheitsstrategie us in the redefine the transatlantic relations can be helpful . 
the Members of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party in this House welcome the report by Mr Morillon as an important contribution to this process . 
the European differences of opinion on the subject of Iraq have made it clear that we are not able , in terms of security issues to speak with one voice and , however , we should not forget that Europe on a common trade policy , a joint development policy and on a particularly entstehendes diplomatic corps in the form of Kommissionsbüros in the world . 
these are powerful instruments , which is still a great deal more powerful , if they as part of an integrated foreign policy linked . 
our foreign policy is inconsistent , because it on three Commissioners , the Council presidency and the High Representative of the Council is distributed and because some Member States to deny that we have fundamental common interests in the field of foreign policy , or the Commission , to take a leading role . 
without a common defence policy , it is Europe in the for a credible common foreign policy necessary military influence . 
our common defence budgets to less than half of the expenditure of the United States and make it clear that the EU does not invest enough in the defence of our citizens have higher Verteidigungsetats would welcome . 
it not be enough , more to invest : we must use the funding more effectively , especially for fundamental requirements as strategic Lufttransporte , Präzisionslenkwaffen and Tankflugzeuge . 
that is why the Liberal Group supports the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency armament and research to control the defence budgets . 
we want to begin cheaper and , if the EU countries also think that , outside the EU produced supplying arms are able to meet our criteria and the cheapest , then we should not in a fehlgeleiteten Anflug of protectionism European option . 
in this way we would be repeating the mistakes of the common agricultural policy . 
more effective defence budgets must come up with a greater decision making . 
Parliament cannot with its clear and unanimous message in favour of a strong and effective European Security and Defence Policy to the European Convention in the form of the report of General Morillon hope influence on the discussion . 
by the appointment of a single representative for Foreign Affairs , the from the ranks of the Commission , but additional resources and expertise from the Member States , we will be a great deal of progress in the links between the grundverschiedenen elements in the field of foreign and security policy . 
we must also more flexibility in the introduction and implementation of crisis management of the day and giving if necessary , for the constructive abstention . 
there are clear reservations about this possibility , but the introduction of a clause to the collective defence in the new constitution-treaty , similar to that of the Treaty on the Western European Union is also the clause which seems to be necessary . 
this may not immediately progress with all 15 Member States , let alone with 25 Member States . 
I therefore welcome the initiative of the Belgian government , in this month a meeting with France , Germany and Luxembourg to issues of defence policy . 
progress in the European integration can often only by the resolute use of a group of determined countries , which is a matter moving and then other countries . 
nevertheless , I represent the opinion that a greater cooperation on defence issues all the governments , which is to take part in this should be open to continue and that the British Government in particular , because of its military capacity and experience will . 
finally , I would like to point out that a European security and defence policy by NATO guaranteed collective Sicherheitsstruktur supplement as long as there is a rationalisation of the Rüstungsbeschaffung , a added value in the form of a doctrine on the basis of conflict prevention and crisis management and a creditable threatened use of military measures and a more coherent and common approach to the security policy . 
let us of our European Security and Defence Policy , on the Amboss of hope and from the steel our ashamed with a view to Iraq . 
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Morillon , that he at the beginning of his report has pointed out , as the guiding principle of the European foreign and security policy . 
in its considerations , he says - in my opinion , and rightly so - that the crisis prevention must be the guiding principle . 
only in emergency situations , only in crisis situations , the European Union is also about military resources . 
it is precisely this order is the support of my political group , and this is the reason why we are also in favour of , for example , the use of the European Union in Macedonia and Bosnia . 
this means that the European Union , finally , I would say , on the were last funds in the Gesamtspektrum of foreign and defence policy instruments . 
in addition to the diplomacy , in addition to economic resources now also military resources , but if you please in this order . 
I would like to highlight two chapters of the report . 
first of all , the General - in my opinion rightly - by means of an amendment proposed that a certain point in relation to the already contained in his report , as yet , which is the need for a strategic approach . 
what are the specific objectives of the European security policy ? 
where do we want ? 
what we need this ? 
when we want to do this ? 
such an approach , I believe that this is an excellent report . 
I am also an absolute advocates a review of the Petersberg tasks - so that the official description of our in my opinion , far too limited strategic approach . 
I am , however , to begin , and then on , for example , only to discuss the territorial defence , including in the report by Mr Morillon , in my opinion , only volatile comments . 
this is now suddenly to the tasks of the European Union ? 
we must Article 5 of the WEO-Vertrags ? 
I believe that such a decision to be premature . 
first of all , we should deal with the strategic approach and then to consider what these European instruments should be achieved . 
similarly , I think it would be too early to say that in the year 2009 should we be able to a task as in Kosovo . 
only the examination of the strategic concept and then the adoption of these specific tasks . 
secondly , another important point of the report which often existing misunderstanding , although , as well as in the contributions of Mr Patten and Mr Watson a little angeklungen - said that we are not sufficient financial resources for the vorzusehenden actions available . 
the problem , ladies and gentlemen , is not that too little money is available , but that it is not enough and efficient enough and that it will be used so far has been in a Arbeitsspezialisierung . 
where the problem lies . 
let us . 
I am pleased that this is also in the report by Mr Morillon expressed clearly . 
with regard to the financing begrüßenswerterweise - I am in favour of the rapporteur - the gradual transferring the funding of , in my opinion , completely non-transparent national Ad-hoc-Haushalten between Member States , the any democratic control , to the EU budget . 
there are many arguments as to whether it is only the impact on the European defence policy , the European Parliament , at last , in this respect , as the defence budgets to be financed from the Community budget . 
finally , I would like to a point of my main concern is . 
in this Parliament , and also with the Council , we are agreed that the effectiveness of should be increased . 
we must be able to act faster and more efficient . 
I agree , ladies and gentlemen , but then , if you please on the basis of a specific strategic plan . 
my fear is , however , that a fundamental Zubehör , namely the democratic control , this will have . 
a further increase the effectiveness and improve our potential without clarity about where the democratic control of security policy , is not . 
if we are in favour of the majority of Parliament - and I think that qualified majority voting in the area of security policy , then we must want - in the exercise of democratic control of the European Parliament cannot be excluded . 
effectiveness is necessary , but if you please , together with democratic control , and this must be ultimately here in this Chamber . 
Mr President , the recent international events have once again shown how urgently a European Union , of the need for the closed action is capable of both if it is to defend their own safety , and , if it is necessary , the right of each people to the quest for a democratic and pluralist , the rights of individuals and wahrenden system to protect the rights ; a Europe that the diplomacy at long last , the diplomatic services - and the provision of each Member State can bring together those cooperation , which the Council , the need , always with the problems of the world politics , in order to be able to reach decisions which , as far as possible the whole of the Union . 
it is of primärer importance , the whole of the foreign and security policy debate and the resulting ableitenden decisions again in the framework of the Council . 
it is also of primärer importance , a single European representative for these two areas of policy . 
with this issue has also of the convention . 
by some Member States are actually outside of the Council &apos; s meetings are held , legitimate initiatives , but they are not initiatives of the European Union . 
that is why it is obvious that we are facing a European security and defence policy , which is also a military instrument , such as that of Mr Morillon &apos; s proposed peace and democracy , can guarantee supported . 
this European forces to be the national armed forces of all the Member States will arise , and also to the development of citizenship an additional impetus , because this is Inter alia from the proud feeling that every citizen of its belonging to his country and the European Union must feel : a free and independent European Union , winner of a project of peace and mutual respect for the rest of the world , a project which not only on the presentation of documents , noble declarations of intent or the production of trading relations must be based , but with proper powers for the fight against terrorism and the defence of our values of our vision of the world and our freedom where institutions . 
Mr President , it is always the same . 
if the European Chimären transgresses the reality of , then develop our &apos; europabewegten &apos; Träumer to new and even absurdere ideas , both in a headlong , which would be ridiculous , would it not dangerous . 
Mr Morillon , with the report before us today is the myth of a European defence , in fact , a old hat one can . 
it was already the whole of the twentieth century through the dream of einfältigen Geistern - without any practical outcome . 
already Aristide Briant widespread this idea with the dramatic , the opposition and the Verteidigungsbereitschaft in France . 
this has been 1948 fixe idea on the Congress of The Hague aufgetischt again and then 1950 by a certain Winston Churchill with the EVG , the from its Träumereien was born and key brake . 
we must , moreover , the French Parliament , which is to put an end to it . 
fifty years later , we are still in the same , in other words , there are no progress has been made . 
we have made some progress so little that the key element of a common defence policy , the establishment of a European defence industry - not only not make progress , it has , since , as we can hardly be pointed out , the majority of the Europeans to buy weapons with each other but not to approximately 60 % of the United States . 
this would be started if a defence policy is to be speech . 
but this is a myth defence policy , because there is no defence policy without a common foreign policy . 
this has been done in 1992 in ehernen credit in title V of the Maastricht Treaty , but it is in any crisis , either in Rwanda , in Afghanistan , even in Kosovo , has been achieved . 
this is not succeeded in all of us , because we hinterherliefen blind to the United States . 
and now they platzt once again , the common foreign and security policy . 
we should no longer these Chimären nachlaufen . 
Europe must be based on the reality . 
and the realities , as is now clearer than ever , the Member States will be visible . 
this must not one of its main components allow : the will to defence and the necessary resources . 
I will confine myself here to express the wish that France , whose global responsibility , always will be able to strengthen its own Verteidigungsmittel , because this is the only , the best contribution to the what Europe still remains . 
Mr President , with the words of a French Komikers : to talk about everything is in all , and vice versa . 
in view of the obvious collective failure of the so-called European Union in areas such as economic growth and employment , the rapporteur , who , unfortunately , it seems to have forgotten that he General of the French army for a Verteidigungskonzept , the purely and simply a link France to a level would mean which is currently - that , if anything , the Belgian should meet . 
this will , of course , tirelessly of all those for various reasons , which is in the concept of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; the possibility of a up against stumbling blocks , to restore European unification process . 
the current war in Iraq should , however , for all these Schöngeister at long last , be an opportunity to understand that the nations kaltblütige monster , are the only in their own interests . 
the recent failure of the European Transportflugzeugs , that is a much more quickly and much cheaper can be produced , which would have had endless Geschachere about the GALILEO project , the extremely high costs each Rüstungsfabrikation on multinational basis , the fate of hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are threatened - all that has no significance for these Berufspolitiker , whose only aim is , as long as possible in power . 
the enlarged Europe needs stability , but this cannot , of course , be achieved by new legal Kunstgriffe , unpraktizierbare cooperation , unfähige organisms , supposed powers or Vortäuschungen are . 



whatever our current differences of opinion on the Nahostproblematik all Eurosceptic without exception and without reservations this fixe idea of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; . 
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it has always been my dream , after a de Gaulle to speak , but not for a that such speeches . 
we are now , when we this debate on the future of European security and defence policy , witness the war in Iraq . we believed that this war with diplomatic means to be able to prevent . 
but we are , because we across the political and military because we were not existent . 
as a war or peace , once again , we were not prepared . 
we too late , as in Bosnia , as in Kosovo or , as in Afghanistan . 
in any of these armed conflicts , the European Union as an international player , the mitbestimmt . 
therefore , is one of the Kernsätze of the report , Mr Morillon , that only a Union with clearly defined foreign policy objectives and interests , equipped with effective military capability , that counts . 
just such a Union can a self-employed player in world politics and a selbstbewusster partners in the transatlantic relations . 
there is now so many head of government , given its powerlessness in the Irak-Krieg öffentlichkeitswirksam now he says that the objective of a European Verteidigungsunion thereof . 
I wonder whether this Government because it is not in the decisions since Helsinki in 1999 involved ? 
why did they do not do more , so that the Rapid Einsatztruppe map of the EU convincing 2003 at the latest technology , and with the relevant Kommandostrukturen transport and operational ? 
why was the Anpassungsreform their national forces behind the new Sicherheitsherausforderungen back ? 
why have been a diminution in the seeing in this way ? 
why did you for the transport of its own soldiers in their own country to the Flugzeugvermieter Ukraine go ? 
the European Parliament has continually since 1999 , that the foreign policy instruments of the Union to military capability . 
of course , it is now in the convention . 
this report is also the European Parliament &apos; s contribution to the future : how can the European Union to protect the safety of their citizens with new threats by terrorism and how can the European Union to peace and stability in the world ? 
because Präventivkriege without legitimacy we must never again ! 
we therefore support in this report all those who , in the Convention for the updating of the Petersberg tasks , which are to ensure that a vanguard of Member States military Krisenmissionen can take the for a kind of European Rüstungsagentur are , for a European Beistands- and Solidaritätsklausel and in particular to the crucial point of majority decision-making in the foreign policy and the closer cooperation in the defence policy to introduce . 
we believe , however , the governments should be clear on the following : millions of people have in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges in the roads of the cities of Europe demonstrated in favour of that war and peace , but parliaments Kabinette do not have to decide . 
anyone who decide on facility of a European Einsatztruppe , we need a very high level of democratic legitimacy . 
let me a final opinion : all future facility in the context of the ESDP will be given a civil and military part . 
it is precisely this is what we are of the NATO . 
in Bosnia , we have now with a police mission . 
perhaps next year we solve the SFOR-Mission of NATO . 
we cannot cohesion between civil and military operations , if the best way for both the same rules , and the common costs on the budget of the European Union . 
this has to do with parliamentary control , but that it is also the governments win democratic support and support for their actions . 
the citizens of the European Union at any rate , of course , already say in the report , Mr Morillon , the concept of a European defence policy . 
71 % of the citizens of Europe are in favour of this . 
only the Kabinette have not yet understood . 
Mr President , I would also like to Mr Morillon , on his excellent report , and I can already tell me that it is possible , some of the objectives and proposals , to support it . 
as has already been said , the debate to find an appropriate time . 
the war in Iraq has divided Europe . 
that is why , in the public opinion , doubts as to the ability of the European Union , to außereuropäischer level there with one voice . 
today &apos;s debate on the European defence policy is , therefore , to a very dubious moment . 
the ideas are still not , however , and without new initiatives can be wiedergutgemacht not angerichtete damage . 
in the European Convention is currently on the strengthening of the Beschlussfassungsstrukturen . 
the report , Mr Morillon , contains a whole series of practical proposals to improve the Verteidigungsfähigkeit the EU . 
we support the enlargement of the Petersberg tasks , which also include the fight against terrorism . 
the Schnelleingreiftruppe must be more attention . 
if , in future , truly independent operations of this force to be possible , it is also a more efficient organisation of the defence industry in Europe . 
in implementation of all these objectives of the European Union with a useful military capacity . 
the European Union will then have still not a military superpower . 
this is not the intention . 
in the context of a comprehensive security policy with the crisis , the European Union , the simultaneous use of several instruments . 
such a concept is a credible military component . 
the Irakkonflikt has bewusster our weaknesses , however , this is no reason for complete amendment of the Grundkonzepts . 
the European Union must , together with other countries , and within multilateral framework to be able to accept their responsibilities , when it comes to the international legal system . 
the recommendation , the development of foreign and security policy with a vanguard active Member States to speed up deserves support . 
the pace should not be guided by the principle . 
I am , however , for an open process . 
anyone who would like to endorse the opportunity to them . 
Mr President , the report Morillon refers to the European defence as part of a realistic and responsible strategy of solidarity and complementarity with the United States and is therefore a strong step forward , of the forecasts , economic victims and military investment . 
it is a necessary and urgent step , in which the new terrorist and state threats not be underestimated . 
a Agenda , which is in line with my proposals , which I last year with the study &apos; A European sword &apos; have tabled . 
the report avoid dangerous illusion that neither the security and democracy in the world would strengthen the unity of Europe . 
these dangerous illusion the resurgence of a unilateral Pazifismus , a return to the previous unilateral Pazifismus of the &apos; prefer red as dead &apos; . 
a further illusion is one of Europe , the independent , strong and einflussreich , because it is of the United States has losgesagt : an illusion , which is the fault of the USA-feindlichen and for the European supranational policy unempfänglichen Gaullismus , especially in the field of foreign and defence policy . 
it is an illusion , the deep in the European nationalism and in now is rooted in ideologies an illusion , which has the strange Rechts-Links-Bündnis in relation to the war in Iraq declared and on the other hand , the principle of democratic intervention has magnified . 
these political illusion is more dangerous than the imperiale Unilateralismus and the blinde Pazifismus : the right to Europe , he has divided ; he has divided the Fifteen , he has insulted the countries of Eastern Europe , while the Wiedervereinigungsprozess was that he has the distance from the United States increased and before the possibility of the exercise of the right of veto to cripple the Security Council , so that he justifications for the military intervention outside of the UN did . 
before the European Union the development of the institutional system reallocate their political vision , it must be clear ; it is the safety of their population , their own territory and its borders ensure - and it has failed to do in the Balkans - it must be the erosion of the Rüstungskontrolle and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to bloody dictatorships to take on board and they must strongly against terrorism and for the safety of Israel , and also a democratic Palestinian State . 
if the Union is a neither unterwürfige still hostile , either resigned still dependent allies of the United States , it must be a common defence and gradual the leadership of the Atlantic Alliance , in which the United States now only 8 % of their armed forces have committed . 
in order to do this , it is of the agreement of Saint-Malo between France and Great Britain and of this report by Philippe Morillon , because they today the culmination of the preparation of the European security policy , the consolidated and , on the whole Union needs to be extended . 
Mr President , we should today , as we speak about the European security and guarantee the future for all of us can make sure . 
in particular in the last few years and on 11 September , we have seen that military weapons no guarantee of security . 
quite the contrary , we could say because , if a country in the world is military well equipped , it is the United States , which Terroraktion victims of a on 11 September . 
this terrorist attack by the previous weapons has not , therefore , be prevented . 
the Rechtsruck , in the United States has been in this area , heaven forbid the security considerations in Europe . 
there is - global and within the EU - a complete discrepancy between the investment in military equipment and our investment in a truly sustainable security . 
the problem is that the report Morillon these abuses not eliminated , as one of the reasons for this is that I cannot support it in the final analysis , although he many good and right analyses , on the need for a European identity in these areas . 
but if these identity is something that we should be to follow what is already has proved ineffective and ineffectual than we are in the wrong track . 
this is not a sign of Pazifismus , because I believe that a nation has the right to defend its own rights , and I also believe that it can be situations in which military power to the peace is necessary . 
but the threat that we are facing , not by military means . 
it is primarily the desperation of people in a very unfair world , and we should focus our efforts . 
Madam President , allow me to begin by thanking Mr Morillon , for the effort which he has made Zusammentragen of the different viewpoints . 
Mrs Frahm from my Group has already stated that we , the report despite its positive content from three clear reasons can accept . 
the first reason is our dependence of NATO , a fact that the European Union in addition to the American giants as a Zwerg can be , and , if the European Union , then they need to develop its own personality . 
otherwise , there is no future for the European Union . 
the second reason is the need for , after the end of the war in Iraq deliberate , because we must make it very clear that the current risk in the world the aggressive behaviour of the United States . 
on 20 September strategy presented by the United States , wars in the whole world . 
next will Syria , Iran , Korea to the number - who knows ? 
I do not want to name in order to suggest objectives . 
it is a major threat of safety . 
my third point is , therefore , the European Union is a fundamental role in the democratic strengthening of the United Nations and of the Security Council must play . 
we must also work to the objective , conflicts in line with the law necessarily before the General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council to ensure - and this is what the United States does not do . 
the contribution that the European Union , is a success . 
we are of many countries South America have been said , despite the fact that , in my opinion , completely unjustified - pressure has carried out , the President Mr Aznar , so that the two countries , which are members of the Security Council , the war against Iraq , this dignity and courage way and Europe gave an example of peace and international law , in favour of a more important than the dangerous Abenteuern of the United States . 
Madam President , in his explanatory statement for an EU armed force , General Morillon : &apos; the governments of the Member States to continue to the Americans , any wars , and only with questions of peace , then I think the European Union must accept that it is the role of the Athens in ancient Rome : this is in the final analysis , would accept that there is the desire of a new Empire . &apos; 
as I prefer Athens , the cradle of culture and of democracy , the separate Rome , which is the enemy of the whole world and , ultimately , in blood and fire was sinking , while the Greek weiterlebt in all areas of the Olympic Games to the EU-Ratsvorsitz . 
general Morillon wants , that the EU is doing the same as the United States in Kosovo , or perhaps in Iraq or in one of the smaller countries , against the United States in the last century Angriffskriege . 
he wants , that the EU in the entire planet while not accepting , particularly in the Balkans , in the Middle East , in the Caucasus in Mittelasien and Africa , by taking military action . 
in such a scenario is , of course , no room for non-aligned countries . 
all are bound by a so-called Solidaritätsklausel , and a UN mandate is absolutely no longer be necessary . 
if the EU , the Roman way of General Morillon , can it be done , that of a fine day a EU-Präsident hand in hand with the President of the United States debated in what oil and mineralreichen developing country the poor next time in the Steinzeit zurückgebombt . 
any attempt , in the militärtechnischen area us with the United States , but the risk that the lethal arms race of the Soviet Union . 
certainly the Europeans then billion people also attach such as the Americans . 
the EU embassies will be demonstrators million , show the Eiffelturm will be the fate of the World Trade Center share , the UN , will undermine the Zivilisationskrieg will spread and the European population , which will fall to the losers , how many Superwaffen following the example of the United States , we move . 
if General Morillon with his views , we in the best mentioned the book &apos; The sinking of the Abendlandes &apos; of Oswald Spengler from the Regal , in order to understand what will happen . 
if we , as General Morillon the which aspires to try to build a modern Rome , we shall also be the fate of Roms . 
no , we are the plans for a military superpower ad once and let us listen to our Sacharow-Preisträger ! 
we take the Dalai Lama &apos; s seriously , the our the was . 
the European Union has only reject as a chance of survival and a raison d &apos; être . 
let us a civil peace corps under EU-Regie . 
rather than to make fools of ourselves , we should prefer lessons from the experience of the Member States , which 200 years from wars heraushalten . 
the specific characteristics of the European Union is to peace . 
should the United States war , to the Americans themselves in blood and fire sink , such as the Römer ! 
but let us in the culture and stick to Athens of democracy . 
Madam President , the events of 11 September 2001 , the world remember that we are not a matter of peace and security . 
in this light , it is commendable that the countries of Europe itself recognises the need to have a greater responsibility . 
at stake , namely our own credibility and safety . 
this will not be fluctuation in . 
it is the report Morillon was quite right to the view that , in relation to the collective defence NATO bond is essential that the same time , however , the development of an autonomous European security and defence policy . 
not to mention the wholly inadequate Verteidigungsanstrengungen in Europe . 
in short , the report , Mr Morillon , shows no clear way . 
what is naheliegender as an adequate contribution of the EU Member States in the NATO ? 
one thing is certainly : in connection with Iraq to implement differences between the European members , as well as the controversial initiative , a group of the European defence policy are not helping that the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy is currently a credible basis for the safety of the citizens in the Member States of Europe . 
these people is with a unanimous strong NATO . 
Madam President , between the drafting of the report , Mr Morillon , and today there are major international developments , the effect that the issues of the defence of Europe will no longer be dealt with globally and a uniform manner . 
we can no longer act as if there is still in the establishment of a common defence policy for the purpose of the implementation of a common foreign and security policy of all the Member States . 
the arguments of the Security Council on basic issues have taken place , then the beginning of a further after the war in Kosovo , this time against Iraq , in violation of the provisions of the Charter of San Francisco have the considerable differences clearly , what between the present and future Member States of the European Union in the field of foreign policy . 
it is patently two Konzeptionen of Europe and its role , two types of foreign policy , two opinions of the international order . 
we must recognise this . 
it would be the wrong way forward if we versteifen would only a the circumstances , to see geschuldete crisis , which , as soon as it has once again , would enable us to the old approaches and to return to the common one essentially little semantic games in connection with the CFSP and the ESDP to start again . 
in future to everything at Union level , with foreign affairs and defence , only the concept of variable geometry . 
in this previously fakultativen approach is no way now more . 
it is a variable geometry , which , furthermore , more efficiency and less idle chit-chat . 
the convention should now his talents in this respect . 
in the report , Mr Morillon , the proposals which must be seen as representative of the most recent developments , which are completely obsolet and those who are still appropriate . 
in the first category , I would , in particular , paragraph 54 that in the proposes that the European Union a permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council . 
this proposal is clearly contrary to the current needs of Europe , continue to two constant members of the Security Council , so that the two different Konzeptionen , the two different Hauptwege which the countries of Europe , can be expressed . 
in the second heading in my opinion , the proposals to the necessary cooperation , the first in the field of the fight against terrorism , what the consequences of the Irakkrieges still necessary , and , secondly , in the area of production and the Kaufes of course must be developed . 
the recent events have also to make it quite clear what damage in Europe , with the ideology of the Friedensdividende . 
I therefore welcome the fact that the concept of Community preference in the report Morillon in zweckdienlicher way , which has surfaced once again , however , I regret that this with his disappearance in another also coinciding strategically important area : the CAP , i.e. the competence in the food or , in order to use the American terminology - the Nahrungsmittelwaffe . 
the supply , as the report , Mr Morillon , is to say , must for food as for supplying arms . 
we must ensure that Commissioner Lamy this in the negotiations of the Doha-Runde not mind . 
Mr President , we know that discussions on a common security and defence policy are currently for the supporters of the realistic or even überrealistischen school a kind of wishful thinking . 
however , it is precisely under the present circumstances , this report , with its Denkanstößen of all the more interest . 
basically , we can only support this report , because it is based on fundamental arguments on the European Parliament and the citizens of the Union , there is agreement in particular , to respect the principles of the UN Charter and the law , to a framework for the guidelines of the common foreign policy , the the Security and Defence Policy , on the need for us that Europe responsibility in the field of security and defence policy , starting of military assistance for humanitarian Hilfseinsätze , conflict prevention and -lösung to maintaining transatlantischer relations and a multilateral approach . 
however , I would like to point out that , in the report perhaps too much in the depth and even some details that are clearly not be too . 
if , for example , paragraph G the Kriegsrecht mentioned , is not clear whether the Geneva Convention is criticised now or not . 
in addition , I do wonder at this stage , the question is : should we not more attention to the existing resources must be streamlined , by our expenditure merge , Doppelungen and avoid the interoperability between the armed forces of our countries ? 
could the sektorenweise distribution of appropriations for the defence in each country to be improved . 
some countries , after all , of course , be 70 % or more for staff and maintenance . 
it could perhaps a joint contribution to a priority , such as the area of research , modern systems in the rule results both industry and the economy can be of use . 
having said that this is a debate on a very practical matters , which is only right now . 
Madam President , the events of the last time , show that the EU Member States either now or in the future will be able to come to a common defence organisation . 
the EU Member States , the members of NATO , represented quite different views in relation to the Irakkrieg , as far as the general attitude of these countries to the new world order , which . 
this makes it difficult to create a common defence policy . 
the neutral Member States and do not want that the EU is to become a military alliance or or a military superpower . 
under these circumstances it would be reasonable if the EU will continue to crisis management and the NATO as a system of collective safety for the EU Member States , which belong to this as an organisation . 
Germany , France , Belgium and other gleichgesinnte countries could have a close mutual military cooperation within NATO and a defence community , which is a strong European pillar of the NATO would operate . 
this system would cooperation between Europe and North America , which is very important for us all . 
in NATO Europe could have its own defence identity , but the defence community would cooperate closely with the United States . 
the other EU Member States - both the members of NATO and the neutral , would , in turn , play a role in the transatlantic link to maintain and consolidate . 
the emergence of a defence community could even to a more general internal differentiation within the Union on the basis of considerations , the leading French and German experts and politicians have employed over the years . 
then let different institutions to the heart of the Union , such as the German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has proposed . 
Madam President , I believe that all members of the European Parliament on 18 years , the average age is 40 or 50 , and that is why we should not play with Zinnsoldaten . 
I am not General and this is not , therefore , I have just done my Wehrdienst , without the Unteroffizier been appointed to be . 
I can , however , while I am here to speak , not the Fotografie on the front page of the newspaper &apos; s &apos; s Guardian by my internal eye , which shows where these conduct preventative wars use . 
and I can also not from my memory , what I have seen on television five minutes , namely a people which not only for days bombing , but it is up to the redundant has been out of humiliation borders , with plundering , theft and all the what we in the TV with . 
in these circumstances because we want to be here with visitors , journalists , before the interpreters on armament and mechanisms to discuss and not our attention to , where we are ? 
we can accept paragraph 17 in the &apos; krisenpräventiven nature of &apos; military actions , if a preventative war that is what Mr Bush and Blair in Iraq have begun ? 
we can accept , paragraph 9 in the it means that terrorism the idea of geografisch limited military commitments lapses and the traditional distinction between the policy of the external and internal security ironed out ? 
what do we do ? 
we are opening even wide open the door to a war in Syria , in Iran , in North Korea and later , Mr Morillon , in France . 
for this reason , this is a useful debate . 
where we are to see . 
not to say that it is bad for us to be divided over . 
to say that what the two sides in the European Union . 
the side of the principles of the Charter in the United Nations Security Council has violated or side , the an action in accordance with the UN has supported ? 
the political basis on which we analyse the European Union , which is not a real caricature of the United States will be , but a Pol of peace , the diplomatic services and the restrained action in a twenty-first century , at any level , the twentieth century same . 
Madam President , Commissioner , as has been aware that Europe , despite the fact that there is the most important commercial power , only a very important role to play in the world stage , if it on a common foreign and security policy , the so-called third pillar in the Treaty of Maastricht and the creation of einsatzbereiter militärsicher capacity to ensure peace of the priorities . 
in a world which is increasingly global and vernetzter , it is so far been our policy , to international law , particularly on the United Nations , but also on other global organisations . we therefore have a legal framework for the international relations conceived , because we are convinced that this is the best way possible conflicts to prevent and deal with them . 
and we believe that the European Union within this world order should speak with one voice , the it as a trade , economic and social power and a great defender of the human rights , the Multikulturalismus caveat so and the environment . 
the reality of our current situation , however , is disappointing . 
once again , the Home division on at various summits made grandiose statements by the Heads of State and Government . 
I refer to the different positions which the fifteen countries in the United Nations Security Council to the conflict in Iraq have represented . 
the behaviour of Mr Aznar , the Spanish head of government , and various others , would be as reprehensible alone , therefore , to call this division , because it has caused . because rather than on the adoption of a common position adopted by the Council of the European Union , and they have been waiting for the instructions of the spoken , to create a new unilateral world order . 
the worst thing is that Mr Aznar and his colleagues an illegal war there have been promoting a humanitarian disaster in the thousands of children , women and civilians , mutilated or were injured and fear , hunger and disease . 
and the worst thing is that Mr Aznar , has contravened the constitution , without the approval of the European Parliament or the consent of the King of Spain , and that he , together with its Getreuen contrary to the global opinion and the opinion of the weapons inspectors and without the support of the UN Security Council . this has acted the law and the international institutions and a powerful blow to the Stärksten victims of the world , the violence and open the door of the good sense and justice , second and third pillars . 
in sum , I would like to say that we have to them , once again that the world governed by the law of the jungle and that the third pillar of the European Union to . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mr Philippe Morillon on his excellent report . 
this debate and also the fact , as a few amendments are relatively it has shown that it has understood , in this very important issue a very broad consensus in this House . 
if we do with the situation before five years in similar debates , we see that , today , there is a very broad consensus on the need for a European Verteidigungsbeitrags in this House . 
for this , I would like to congratulate Philippe Morillon . 
his report is an important building block in the development of a Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
why is it necessary ? 
we have in September of last year , the new Sicherheitsstrategie taken note of the United States . 
we are at the moment , such as this week after week , the United States Sicherheitsstrategie systematically is implemented . 
what we as Europeans , there is a need for a European Sicherheitsstrategie answer . 
it is essential that we as Europeans as building block a common foreign policy , first of all our interests jointly . 
I believe that this is possible . 
firstly , there is a broad consensus that we , as the European Union to capable of us in the framework of NATO , together with our allies , if necessary , but also against any possible Angreifer autonomously to defend themselves . 
I would very much welcome it if the convention , were to a mutual Beistandsklausel for the new constitution for the European Union . 
secondly , we should develop the capabilities . this means that we need a little time , the geographical context of the European Union necessary contributions to the management of crises , and zivil and militarily . 
this is not yet the case today , we can have not yet autonomous , but this is a capacity that we need to develop . 
thirdly , we should be the European Union to be able to everywhere in the world and always Rettungsoperationen , when it comes to the safety of European citizens . 
these are three further building blocks for an Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
if we do we need to develop the experience , which we take account of in similar major projects have made , as in the case of the internal market or in the European currency . 
these were only a success because , that is why we clear content and long-term targets have made , what matters when we wanted to be in a position . 
some answers to this subject in the report by Philippe Morillon . 
what the citizens of the European Union , is peace , security and stability . 
as a European Parliament , we must make our contribution that the European Union as a whole this claim indeed . 
Madam President , in connection with Iraq schwankte my mood between anger , Bedrückung and determination . 
I am furiously vote in favour of the arrogance and the Selbstüberschätzung of the United Kingdom and the United States , as they have started to have the war . 
I am saddened that the European Union in its efforts to prevent this war , and a peaceful disarming the Iraqis , so powerless . 
but I am also determined to ensure that , if I can this with my own small way that we have a rather united , coherent , uniform , common European foreign and defence policy . 
I am convinced that a rather united European Union would have been able to prevent this war , Saddam Hussein &apos; s to disarm and also a major contribution to the production of peace between Israelis and the Palestinians . 
this is a possibility there is still , and we should do everything within our power to our relatively passing to , which in many cases to national self-interest , and in this way , to a common position for Europe . 
we in the world an important role to play , and we should also now try to meet this role . 
in view of the most serious Sicherheitskrise after the end of the Cold War we have not been able , as a Union seriously and effectively against this crisis . 
this is very shocking . 
it would be töricht to adopt the war against Iraq would be a one-off plan for war . 
it is obvious that Syria , Iran and also , of course , Cuba and North Korea also on the list . 
the European Union must at last , the situation in the and make it clear that we , the type of action against Iraq have begun , and that together we do not support serious and peaceful mechanisms of the prevention of conflicts are about to set up in order to achieve what the world needs , namely the stability and peace . 
the today in the forefront of Europe are only prepared the politicians , to speak with one voice , when it comes to their own ideas . 
the common foreign and security policy is obviously not important enough for , in order to make concessions . 
as long as the foreign policy in the European Union will continue to renationalised , will be a common defence as a steuerloses Kampfflugzeug pilots , which is , in the air depend . 
both the exaggerated British talks about loyalty to Washington and the permanent French anti-Americanism are not the right guide for the European policy . 
it is to prevent an enlarged Union in a pro- and a antiamerikanisches camp from splintering . 
good transatlantic relations are for Europe , for the United States and for the rest of the world of crucial importance . 
if the United States their pax Americana aufoktroyieren , are the today &apos; s political leaders of Europe to blame . 
as long as they severely to the stick to what they are right , and Europe as a whole too little in the defence investments are we condemned , a Nebenrolle in the world to play . 
the European Union must at least on our own continent , preferably be military action within the framework of NATO , but also independently , if necessary . 
the involvement and strengthening of the military resources will be the basis for a common and solid security policy . 
the development of a European strategic concept , in which the focus on the crisis , is a great goal , however , only then can achieve , if the leaders of Europe exclusively to speak with one voice . 
otherwise , should they prefer to keep their mouths . 
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as a member of the GUE-NGL-Fraktion , of course , I share many of the concerns of the majority of my group , and , in particular , I am of the question : what progress can be achieved in the defence cultures , if they do not have a common foreign policy has been established ? 
I should like to say that I have also Präventivkriege such as , of the current in Iraq , in principle and reject the differences of opinion of the countries of Europe , in this important issue regret . 

nevertheless , think and I say that if we are the monopoly of NATO , as you know , a dominated by the United States and not organisation , conflicts through a strong and effective European diplomacy to regulate , then we must build a Europe of defence . 
we need a sort of Europe with clear objectives and principles , with specific tasks , with adequate capacity and equipment and a legitimate , democratically controlled decision-making process . 
in my opinion , must conflicts throughout the world diplomatic channels , especially in the context of the UN , regulated . 
but in order to have a sufficient diplomatic weight and , therefore , conflicts with diplomatic means to be able to resolve , is a real capacity for implementation of military action , and many others , I think that Europe must not abandon it . 
in short , if Europe fate not in the hands of the United States wants to put it must create the necessary conditions at last , and that the Europe of defence . 
Madam President , rarely has a report is so in good time as the General Philippe Morillon , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur : priorities and weaknesses , unfortunately , more weaknesses . 
firstly , this report comes so that in good time before the until the end aufgehobenen debate on the common foreign and security policy in the convention , and secondly , it is at a time when in Europe , the more pressing issue is the direction in which a security and Verteidigungsarchitektur should move , within NATO or outside NATO , as a partner of the United States in seeing transatlantic alliance or removed from the European short in its infancy ? 
the foreign and security policy of the European Union as conflict prevention and strengthen international security is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the establishment of a common foreign policy , the the prerequisite for the development of a European defence policy , even as a matter of course , is , in this House controversial , even if it since the war in Kosovo is clear that the European Union must be able to exercise tasks , peacekeeping and friedensschaffende what they are already in Macedonia . 
flaws in our attempts are Doppelgleisigkeiten , such as , for example , that the NATO its own rapid intervention force has created a short and so on European rapid reaction force . 
I therefore believe that it is important that , in a Zusatzantrag , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group a permanent task force is asking for which , until 2009 in a Kosovo-ähnlichen conflict in the geographical area of Europe in cooperation with NATO , or even autonomous must be can be . 
this is an open and try to be aware , the Richtungsstreit within the EU &apos; s first . 
Austria has , since the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam made it clear that it is solidarity with in a European security policy . 
we welcome any step in a for practicable direction , and therefore support the concept of General Morillon . 
Madam President , the serious international crisis usually throw a special light on the national differences between the EU Member States . 
although the Union in the area of crisis management a central and successful role in the Balkans and in Afghanistan , we were not in the situation in good time and efficiently the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia . 
the Irakkrieg has the differences from history , Geopolitik and the political priorities of the Member States , to the fore . 
the internal political situation in the various Member States will be further encouraged the controversy . 
we need any special cynicism , if the objective of the common European security guarantees for a utopian dream . 
however , it is clear that the importance of NATO and Europe losing more responsibility for their security and defence policy . 
the anerkennenswerte report by General Morillon is therefore to be a good time . 
perhaps the current weltpolitische crisis and the Bedrohungsszenarien actually encourage us to strengthen the European voice and ability to act . 
we do not suffice , ambitious objectives . 
we must also be determined and practical . 
that is why the European Convention of the Commission &apos; s role in the foreign policy . 
unfortunately , however , things seem to reverse the situation , and the cooperation between the governments adopted . 
we are once again on the contradiction between word and deed . 
in the work of the convention is produced at the same time increased activity of certain Member States to Skizzierung a common defence policy . 
we can adopted by the realistic that within the Union in this area with varying pace , as with Schengen and of economic and monetary union . 
but it is important to ensure that no closed clubs , not all have access . 
in addition , it would be good , the foreign and security policy objectives of the various Member States . 
the Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou has submitted a proposal in this respect . 
in my opinion , this should be taken . 
if we , for example , the from the Geopolitik their differences know , we will also see the potential for cooperation . 
Madam President , &apos; Argos speiste it with the blood the myth - this line from a poem Péguys on Homer the critics of the report , I would like to say , Mr Morillon , because of the report by General Morillon is not a myth but undoubtedly the most interesting and on sorgfältigsten document which was drawn up on this issue which is in the eyes for years . 

the reasons for this positive assessment in the ambitious objective and in which this proposed realistic way . 

it is already on the adequacy of the report on the present time , been pointed out , in its comprehensive nature , the previous speakers have stressed . 
personally , I would like to emphasise the sense of perspective and the excellent exposition of the need to be taken of the Zusammenspiels institutional elements . 
furthermore , I would like the very creative dealing with the concept of closer cooperation , realistic and pragmatic way to the defence cultures , in order to apply the prospect of a genuine Gemeinschaftsverteidigung . 
it is the Bauanleitung for a Europe of defence which , in this report to the present and future realities and in particular to the challenge of terrorism is adapted . 
it is often said that the generals put their armies at last wars . 
I hope that , in the future , no new war , but , as we know , there are many conflicts . 
a general is proposing that we are in favour of the present and future conflicts scenario . 
for that he deserves thanks . 
I do not know whether this terrible neo-colonial war against Iraq soon to an end , but I know with safety , that I the victory of American imperialists in a war which the whole of mankind has opposed to prevent the they not , however , not throw at all . 
a barrier against war by President Bush would have a single position can be of Europe , but the European Union , and is in fact seemed divided and , therefore , powerless and weak . 
the approach of the United States that Europe is in favour of versagte , was not enough ; it would have a specific opposition from the EU as such to sell . 
never was the lack of a single and united voice as significant as in this tragic situation ; never was the absence of the presence of Europe with its own seat so much in the United Nations Security Council . 
Europe can and must , in the world with its own , independent foreign and defence policy by weight , only a separate and independent economic , political and military force , which is not in contrast to the United States , but of them is independent . 
and Europe should , above all , his definition and his commitment to peace solemnly reaffirm , with a simple and clear explanation of how we propose an amendment : &apos; Europe rejects war as a means for resolving international conflict from &apos; . 
Madam President , I can tell you that , in this fortunate citizens in a quarter of Baghdad , together with unbewaffneten US-Soldaten a huge Statue of Saddam Hussein &apos; s from the Sockel . 
the British Conservatives have the quest for an independent European Security and Defence Policy , always as one of the unbesonnensten political objectives of the European Union . 
others have been in turn to the Irrglauben chose that it is the ESDP mainly a question of the European Member States to assume a more comprehensive contribution to the defence . 
if this would be the case , then it is a laudable objectives . 
in reality , however , will the transatlantic alliance further , it will not be extra troops and there is no real purpose , with the exception of a transfer of powers in defence and security of Nato-Hauptquartier - where European countries with our American allies in a negotiating table - to the European Union , in particular exclusion of the United States . 
as the presidency has once again this afternoon , there is the ESDP which European integration . 
the divisions , the within the context of NATO and elsewhere in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges , there were a conscious consequence of this policy . 
the ESDP is not just a threat to NATO , it is an extremely intergovernmental organisation . 
the report by my friend , indeed , General Morillon specifically to the objective of a communitarisation of defence policy within the European Union . 
the reservations I have taken note of Commissioner Patten . 
the British Conservatives speaking against this report , as the Gebrauchsanweisung for an EU armed force and an extensive extension of the Gemeinschaftsbefugnisse in the defence and security . it is proposed , the European Commission far-reaching powers for military operations to grant discharge , including the right of initiative in the area of crisis management . 
the Community budget is the general costs for military operations . in addition , it is a common Beschaffungs- and Produktionspolitik on the basis of &apos; of the military needs of the EU &apos; s as such , the establishment of a common Militärakademie of the EU , a clause for collective defence in the form of a Protocol to the Treaty on European Union , a common EU-Polizeieinheit and a common coastguard and a permanent seat for the EU in the UN Security Council . 
after the British Prime Minister , his experience with the Irakkrieg has done , I hope now that it recognises , as töricht and harmful the establishment of defence structures , which is only to a deepening the gulf between the countries of Europe and the United States . 
I also hope that the United States , despite the wide American / British solidarity in the Irakkrise no longer Tony Blairs use for the ESDP just accepting . 
it should both know better and the consolidation of a new Atlantic Alliance . 
the European Union attaches more importance to their political ambitions as the real security interests of the citizens of the Member States . 
Madam President , the Irak-Krise has the extremely important subject of the common foreign , defence and security policy of the European Union dramatically in the centre . 
the report , Mr Morillon , and the previous report Lalumière give statements and the concerns expressed by Parliament . 
however , they illustrate the political Korrelationen . 
a positive example is the recent presence of the European Union in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia . 
the problem is . 
observations , observations that proposals , but when decisions are made , it is only slowly to their implementation . 
I would like to ask you , as it is with the implementation of the Galileo-Programms ? 
what is the famous Petersberg-Truppe and the Petersberg tasks ? 
as it is with the Eurofighter ? 
as it is with the programme for the construction of the major Lufttransporters , despite the fact that the last two programmes not programmes of the European Union ? 
sometimes , I wonder , we have not culminate in water to Danaïden-Fass ? 
Europe is a peacekeeping force , but it is also a power for security and international cooperation . 
Europe must develop its own person and as an equal partner and an ally to act . 
Europe must its decisions both at institutional and practical level . 
the initiative of Germany and the three other countries is , in principle , to be welcomed . 
we will see . 
often , we have here to the ancient Athens and the old Rome , which ; however , we have recently different vielfarbig gekleidete kings and leaders , from old , untergegangenen colonial Königreichen in goldverzierten car by the capitals of certain European countries paradierten . 
I do not know whether any significant similarity between with certain European political leaders in a divided Europe is , in certain intervals in Camp David or the location of the new Rome their Empfehlungsschreiben . 
finally , I would like to propose , Commissioner , Minister , that is it not perhaps , whether it would be better only symbolic reasons , some of the important meeting political nature , in future , on the location of the European Union , in order to prevent our equality , our potential and our outlook symbolic . 
Madam President , my assessment of the issues dealt with in this report strategic extremely important , but also one of the most urgent European priorities , which the European Union in the context of a uniform and coherent foreign policy , not only in the fight against terrorism , but also in the defence and security capable of action . 
I therefore support the report , Mr Morillon , and I shall support the proposals all these policies and credibility and seriousness into a : the increase in the national defence budgets in the context of this strategy ; a proportion of the EU &apos; s budget for the promotion of research and development ; one on the integration and the cessation of duplicating and waste abzielende planning ; Ad-hoc-Kooperationen and closer cooperation , if some Member States from legitimate reasons do not want to take part in this commitment , transparent and effective integration of the European defence in a renewed NATO , or in a Atlantisches alliance , the sanctity of reiterates once again . 
the next serious Irak-Krise must also those who have supported these targets are not before their Vogelstraußpolitik give up . 
there must be a specific and will visionary at the same time as for the monetary union . 
the convention , Madam President , on the opinion of the majority of Europeans , together with Parliament on the return of effective Multilateralität and a handlungsfähigen Union . 
Madam President , after the report by General Morillon there is a desire , the European Union to militarisieren , and this will also of the advocates of peace . 
as the report in line with the constitution of the EU has been prepared , it was possible to demand measures , which we know that they are already being implemented . 
in the Treaty should be included a separate Solidaritätsklausel , according to which the Member States are obliged to , among other things , to combat terrorist threats . 
the principle of the Präventivkriegs in the EU . 
the military vanguard of the EU Member States the option to pursue a still weitergehendere cooperation : if the crisis management of the EU in the work of the Kampftruppen widened , it is an illegal act without any UN mandate and in defiance of the geographical borders possible . 
the most military countries can another guarantee of security in the form of a statement or a protocol in terms of Article 5 of the EC Treaty . 
well , is that the Kriegsfragen power in the Council must decide unanimously . 
that is better than it was in the Commission to decide whether an attack has been done or not . 
I ask you to remember that , in the EU countries are members of the any Militärbündnis . 
Madam President , the report by Mr Morillon , the told us that Europe is a uniform line and its military capabilities must step up a credible if it wants to be player , this spannungs- and so moment it is precisely the right time . 
the war in Iraq is such a dramatic event , we must not be surprised if it serious differences of opinion between the Member States , but are already my impression after the first signs of a Meinungsumschwungs obvious and is already the a great temptation , on the Siegerseite - the United States , to , as soon as the battle is over . 
the countries against war , I have already stated , a number of Brosamen abzubekommen and to the kind . 
however , as General Morillon - a French General , but also a great supporters of Europe - has said , it is not participating in the decision-making process , if we do not even the burden supports . 
I hope that it has quickly at the end of the political Wahnvorstellungen , which I have just heard in this House and the United States according to Iraq to Syria , Cuba and what I know what countries be attacked . 
the differences between the Member States was clearly not in the European public , the large majority against the American action was . 
fortunately , there was in Europe Heads of State and Government , which have been able to the public misstrauen and its own idea of the world peace : a peace , in this case , unfortunately , only by a war could be made , the was necessary to make a greater tragedies in the coming years . 
if the Union &apos; s own Verteidigungsfähigkeit - as in the report of Mr Morillon , and its own foreign policy , it has a significant role in the world , and I only hope that , then the right decisions . 
Madam President , two thousand years has said that the Römer Cicero that there are two ways of resolving differences exist - negotiation or violence . 
as in people , the latter for wild animals . 
Ciceros words are still in force . 
we want to conflicts as people by negotiations solve or as wild animals by violence ? 
the EU is active prevention or more resources for the human being to develop before birth conflicts , i.e. additional funds to invest in the military area ? 
can the conflicts of today and tomorrow are really to be resolved by ? 
I do not think so . 
what can we from the currently taking place in Iraq war and from the fragmentation of the EU in matters of common foreign and security policy learn ? 
in my opinion , the European Union should step up their international activities , the United Nations and strengthen their capacity for conflict prevention and -lösung , instead of more energy and resources in a common military defence to invest in the final analysis , however , as Commissioner Patten said , national issues . 
the EU should make sure that the reconstruction of Iraq under the aegis of the UN . 
a warring party is not an even-handed , and it is therefore not the responsibility for these reconstruction . 
my own country , Sweden , strongly for conflict prevention , peace and crisis management . 
I support Sweden still does not have a common defence or their joint financing . 
nor , we support the idea that certain countries in the common Verteidigungsarbeit could take the lead , or the introduction of a clause to the collective defence . 
the war is too serious a matter , in the hands of the military to , even in the my colleague Mr General Morillon . 
the most important tasks are the defence of international law , the strengthening of the UN and its work and comprehensive capacity in the Union to Erkennung , prevention and resolution of conflicts . 
this is where the European Union is a major contribution to peace . 
I did Cicero before 2 000 years that only wild animals conflicts through violence to try to resolve . 
it is high time that the EU should have focused on conflicts , instead of going to solve . 
Madam President , I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Morillon on his report , it is precisely the right time , for two reasons : first , the common defence policy is a subject which , in the European Union will be discussed and , secondly , the urgently by other Members have already said . 
the present time , the Irakkrise a problem that affects us all . 
but although the problem is a joint within the European Union has different solutions , as the Union does not have a common foreign policy on a common defence policy . 
perhaps we should remember that , in the years have introduced the founding fathers of Europe , the European defence community . 
but the attempt key brake . this report is a positive step , as well as the report presented by the President of a few years &apos; time . 
it is a long process in which we are working in Europe , in order to create a common defence policy , which is directed against anyone , but on the cooperation with our allies and also with the Alliance , on the other side of the Atlantic . 
this is not a against NATO policy ; a policy geared to the cooperation with NATO . 
just as we have managed in the year 2002 to establish a single currency , in the not each country is involved , however , it will change in the foreseeable future , we must create a common security and defence policy , and in the knowledge that the money is going to cost , but also in the belief that the European Union on the necessary financial resources . 
the convention must take into account in the drafting of the Unionsvertrages . 
Madam President , since the collapse of the real socialism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union will be a when the distribution of new markets and the wealth of the former Socialist countries and the redistribution of the already vergebenen organised markets . 
therefore , there is a angespannter competition between the Member States of the European Union and with the United States . 
at the same time , in the European Union a comprehensive attack on the achievements of workers . 
in order to achieve these objectives , the European defence and security policy , with the report , Mr Morillon . 
obviously , there are actually finding excuses , conflict prevention , crisis management , etc . the truth is that a European army is created , with Söldnern by modern education and training are equipped with modern weapons , whose task is , the interests of big business , wherever it has set and wherever the NATO the orders to intervene , is to defend themselves . 
it is , of course , as the report Morillon state , this is not about the relationship between the European Union and NATO and the United States is considering breaking off . 
on the contrary , there is talk of mutual strengthening and close cooperation with NATO , which is seen as a stroke bonds , the United States and the interests of Europe . 
it also means that this could be , because , among other things , the majority of the Member States of the European Union , the majority of the Member States of the NATO , however , is dominated by the United States and . 
these ties alone would be enough , about the real nature and the task of the famous ESDP to make this clear . 
the people , as we can be sure , no illusion . 
they have had bitter experiences with NATO and the policy of the European Union in security and defence issues of us has profited already . 
the Proklamationen after the events of 11 September , &apos; we are all Americans &apos; , receive in their ears . 
the people saw recently , such as the Member States of the European Union in Prague the new aggressive NATO policy , which covers signed , Präventivschläge . this is exactly what the American and British imperialists at the moment and what they do in Iraq , if the people of permit , will do elsewhere . 
you know , in fact , that the proposals , which armament by an increase in the military , to strengthen the European defence industry a profitable future to ensure that it has , however , for their safety , for the income of people and for the peace process does not bode well . 
it is a disgrace that these proposals have been presented by the Greek government and which , without shame , proud of the fact is that the war before the end of the Greek Presidency will be ready . 
this is not a defence and security policy , it is a policy of aggression and insecurity . and it is precisely for this reason , this policy in contrast to the vision of our peoples , the it . 
the crime in Iraq , that it is now being committed , since we are talking about here , there is , after Yugoslavia and Afghanistan , once again , an idea of the objectives of these policies . 
the people are demanding a diametrically opposed policy , a policy of peace , the peaceful coexistence of the peoples , a policy which resolving conflicts , without of violence and war to demonstrate , a policy of disarmament and peace . 
I am sure that they will this policy , as well as their enemy stemmen against it . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the last Wortbeitrag and even some afraid that I have always : where know , for example , a Kommunist , it is precisely what the people want ? 
others have said here , it is about the distribution of wealth of the socialism . 
I would like , our citizens would listen more these debates . 
a Social Democrat has , of the &quot; colonial centre Camp David &quot; . 
I wonder what we are of arguments in such a debate , and I wonder whether it before the citizens of their country , to say . 
if you take , for example , the Kosovo . 
in Kosovo wanted the citizens , that the European Union ? . 
? . 
Mr Korakas , to the citizens of Europe , that in the twenty-first century on the continent of Europe no further Massenvergewaltigungen and expulsions . 
that is why the European security and defence policy . 
we have seen in 1999 , as Europeans we would be in no position to act , if the Americans would not help us . 
this was the Helsinki Summit 1999 . we have come a long way with what we have developed in the institutions . 
the report , Mr Morillon , as expressed in the excellent way . on 1 April , we have a small mandate for the first time in Macedonia , also to the pacification in a situation in a country , and not military conflicts , such as the result of some raised here . 
I think that are good signals from Europe , the citizens expect from us . 
the time of our debate on this report is a very important . now it is important that both the two extreme parties , the German and the British Government - back again in European institutions and that they are once again trying to European solutions and to find a way to make . 
we all have in this armed conflict realised : in the world , we are all nothing . we cannot have a contribution to peace in the world , when we act against . 
we need European mechanisms . 
what is proposed in this report , is a richtigerer step than the summit will shortly be discussed in Brussels . as meet only four Member States , but at the same again the suspicion that there are more about a against other allies affecting political action . 
we also need Great Britain , with the table , because without Great Britain will this step not succeed . 
Madam President , I should first like to congratulate Mr Morillon , on his report , in the normal balanced way imagination and vision , realism and pragmatism . 
I would like to see him even Mr Korakas , then it would perhaps he would come to a different opinion . 
the real question we face is , of course , provocative said , the European Union should be Militärmacht ? 
I agree with the previous speaker , Mr Laschet right : we have in the last few weeks and months weltpolitisch as Europe , unfortunately , no role . 
this is the fact . 
it is now the will of course , in particular , as Commissioner Patten always says . 
we are prepared , at a role to play ? 
I believe - and the report is , of course , Mr Morillon will be adopted by a large majority , shows that , in this House we wish to have a reasonable weltpolitische role to play . 
we can help in a military ? 
I believe that a military underpin can help us if there is a common foreign and security policy . 
the common foreign and security policy , but not replace can stimulate and help them very well . 
now , I am sceptical about a arms race . 
it would be drunk in fact , we have previously wettgerüstet , because there is a opponents , with which we have a strong . we must now arms race , because there is a partners , namely the United States of America , with which we must gleichrüsten . 
but - and right here - read the report Morillon says , primarily , not solely , but primarily , it is a question of our defence expenditure to coordinate and coordinate so that we firstly with the same amount of a much greater effect , greater efficiency . 
secondly , surely it is also a question to see where are the gaps as Europeans we can finish . 
in fact , there are two alternative models : that it is , as it is , for me is no alternative . 
the alternative is that we as the United States will be a Militärmacht , just a little less , a little less imperialistisch , a little less effective . 
this is not acceptable . 
the other alternative is that we are working for a common foreign and security policy a military justification , Mr Morillon , as expressed in his report , so that we are capable and efficiently , in the context of a multilateral policy to act . 
these are we not at present . 
the report by Mr Morillon , on how we could act in a multilateral framework efficiently . 
we therefore support the report , Mr Morillon loud and clear . 
Madam President , General Morillon has an interesting and sound report which , in some parts of certainly the convention will influence . 
the European defence industry is the key to the development of a common European defence policy , which form part of the transatlantic cooperation . 
we must , therefore , a strong European defence industry is based on , and competition , and . 
we should try to abolish any trade protectionism , also in the field of the arms trade , and the United States of completely opening up of their Waffenmarktes . 
the present system is ineffective and expensive . 
the taxpayers have the right to demand that each and every euro , which is used effectively , we think European . 
a European Rüstungsagentur is therefore absolutely necessary . 
the European taxpayer really believe that it out rationally and efficiently , is the development of three ultramodernen Kampfflugzeugen ? 
the European defence industry COs run the risk of sites Montageanlagen exclusively to the Hochtechnologieforschung . 
this would make Europe less dependent and . 
however , I cannot under any circumstances , we believe that , more without the United Kingdom . 
we should look at the constructive part and on common definitions and methods . 
only with greater budgets for supplying arms and a to research that European defence industry within the framework of a common defence policy , we can be a credible , more efficient and more reliable partner of the United States . 
Madam President , I would like to my honourable friend General Morillon on his report . 
as has already been said , it will have the right time . 
I am a strong supporter of the creation of a EU-Verteidigungspolitik , because I believe that this for a fundamental part of the European integration as the single currency . 
if , in addition , we learn from the debacle want to draw the and , in which the European Union is at the moment , then the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference in the heart of this report arguments to take into account . 
I am a clear in favour of the Transatlantic Alliance between the EU and the United States , but not in its present form , if we merely is expected to the foreign policy objectives of the United States to rubber-stamp , even if we do not agree with them . 
it must be a new balance on the basis of a real partnership will be created , in which the two sides of drawing up the agreed political objectives are involved . 
however , we must understand that we have any influence on the United States , if we are in such a dependence on them . 
as General Morillon said , we must also share the burden . 
furthermore , that a EU-Verteidigungspolitik on a single common foreign and security policy must be based . 
I am not believe that our current differences of opinion on the occasion of our divided response to the crisis in Iraq to give the pessimism and Lähmungserscheinungen should be . 
if anything , then it should be the adoption of the political obligation to ensure that this will never again in the future . 
if we really our influence on the world stage , then we should want to make the EU-Staats- and Government to agree to the offices of the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations zusammenzulegen , a single management with adequate financial services and all our instruments in the strategic sector - including trade , development , the environment , Justice and Home Affairs , on the use , in order to clear political objectives in the heart of our foreign policy . 
it is to be hoped that we in our towards the creation of defence structures not the importance of conflict prevention and continuous investment in our Demokratisierungs- and human rights strategy ignore , because violations in these areas , in many parts of the world will lead to conflicts . 
Madam President , I would also like to support the excellent report by Mr Morillon , in a great way and Euro-Gaullisten integrated Atlantiker . 
as someone who is a great deal of euro-gaullistischer than Mr Morillon , I would like to konzedieren that it is excellent , these two elements Europe to combine foreign and security policy . 
we can the issue of the European defence not discuss the question as to whether we need a European Marmeladen-Richtlinie or not . 
it is merely the raison d &apos;être of the gathering European agreement . 
I do not see it , see that many of our citizens . this is shown by the surveys . 
the meaning of European unification is peace and security , peace and security , both internally and externally . 
that is why it is high time that we make progress in the European foreign and security policy , and I am not as pessimistic as many other colleagues . 
it is true that our governments have a jämmerliches picture . 
but if you look at the peoples of public opinion , so there is between peoples in the great basic issues - also in the Irak-Krieg - a much greater agreement as between the governments . 
I believe that we need instruments and institutions , the common will of the people , not only &apos; , but also an active and honour , because it is not only the respective atmosphere behind . 
we need a responsible long-term strategy as the basis of a common foreign and security policy . 
I believe that the convention is the last opportunity , in the major Community of 15 - and soon the 25 or 30 - of a common foreign and security policy . 
I hope that this . 
I am not Kern-Europa . 
I do not want to fragmentation of Europe . 
but if it in this wider circle not manage to make progress , then it must be a development towards a Kern-Europa . 
however , to a Kern-Europa , which is open for all , which are prepared to a common foreign and security policy . 
I would like to a more say quite clearly : I believe that we need the framework of alliance . 
but even Franz-Josef Strauß , the late chairman of my party , said : &apos; the Atlantic Alliance will only have a future , if it permanently on two equally powerful pillars is built on an American pillar and on a European pillar . &apos; 
and that this European pillar does not exist , is not the fault of the Americans . 
it is our fault as Europeans . 
we will be after enlargement , which we have adopted today , more citizens have as Russia and the United States , and that is why it is high time that we for our foreign and security policy do spend more , the structures .
