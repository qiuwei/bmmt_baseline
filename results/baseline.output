the former fight the MEP from Greece and many of their comrades-in-arms has led to success . 
our rapporteur , Mr Alavanos and Mr Poos , has an important contribution . 
in my opinion , it is encouraging that , at the end of this gap has been taken , the unpraktikablen amerikanisch-britischen plan . 
now , the free Cyprus as a member of the European Union has the opportunity , with the Besatzermacht , Turkey and the local representative , Mr Denktash , a fair political solution to the Zypern-Frage broker a solution to the overwhelming majority of the Turkish Cypriots , together with the Greek Cypriots sehnlichst hopes . 

the Republic of Cyprus is a completely confused legal situation , because the north of the island illegally occupied by Turkey . 
this is in fact , occupation of the United Nations , as well as the European Union . 

nevertheless I believe that it was necessary to vote for the accession , because the Cypriots by a no twice punished would : they are the Turks and would then be rejected by the European Union . 
in fact , would with Turkey a definitive conclusion to be discussed , because it is the only thing they . 
we could have their clearly indicate that they its status as assoziierter partner of the European Union , if they are not immediately from the north of the island . 
I regret that we in the past , do not have the courage to do , but I hope that this will happen in the future . 


but unfortunately , this is not the way in which the Union train heading , because it is still a Schmusekurs by the prospect of Turkey , supporting the assistance doubled and also as Beitrittsvorbereitung einstuft . 
under these circumstances , we ask that , before - I repeat , the opening of the possible accession negotiations with Turkey in all the countries of Europe referenda . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my colleagues in future . 
the Council has , in spite of the warnings and the Commission &apos; s Vorhaltungen during the negotiations - stressed a clear Rechtsbruch . 
with the controversial maintenance of Annex XV the accession treaty and the totally unilateral change to the financial framework of the Council has 2004-2006 the Interinstitutional Agreement ( IIV ) between Parliament and Council on 6 May 1999 broken . 
that is the Budgetrechte of Parliament are being trampled underfoot . 
it also requires Parliament to an alternative either in their rights to fight or the Accession Treaties . 
with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) in terms of accession to the ten applicant countries need to take this view of the ELDR Group in their preparations have completed and needs of each country individually . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , according to the limit of Cyprus , which will soon be a external borders of the Union and , hence , the Netherlands , will be sufficient . 
in addition , we are confident that the EU to find a solution to the Cyprus conflict . 
if we in the vote on the accession of Cyprus contain , not because we certainly have anything to the Cypriot people . 
no , we , the leaders of the European Union Unverantwortlichkeit . 
if we put a divided country whose existenzielles issue is resolved , in the European Union , albeit with some regret that , then this is an ( another ) evidence that the inability of the Union as such , genuine political will to demonstrate . 
the accession of Cyprus to the Union would , of course , dependent on its reunification . 
however , rather than this condition and the question of the accession of Cyprus as a lever to use the European Union , to regret the fact that it is even a divided country . 
we think dare to dream great dreams ! 

this umpteenth wasted opportunity will have the result of a foreign power besetztes country in the Union , Turkey an additional and permanent means of blackmail towards the European Union in the will and the external borders of the Union de facto to the green line set a limit - which neither the European Union parent or otherwise , apart from Turkey to be recognised . 


Mr President , this chapter 5 years it has been our guiding principle of the Union : even before enlargement . 
the Heads of State and Government repeated in learned that the structures and the decision-making process of the Union of enlargement on 25 and more members must be reformed . 
it is with the Treaty of Nice . 
but nothing has been dealt with the Treaty , but the Council of Ministers more complicated . 
therefore , according to the need to create a European convention , to a new Gründungsvertrag , to a European constitution . 
with the signing ceremony of the accession treaties on 16 April 2003 will enlargement before the end of the work of the convention . 
it is an extension of the confusion , especially since the Irakkrise the süßen dreams , in the context of a common foreign and security policy has been made . 
Mr President , I voted for the inclusion of the Republic of Latvia in the European Union votiert . 
as a single representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party , Italy , in this House , I hope and wish that the Letten in the European Parliament , the Republic of Latvia extended , including a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party may choose , together with the other - and I hope that a great many pensioners &apos; parties that exist , representatives of all the Member States , the first time in 2004 in the European Parliament will be to help the interests of the elderly . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my colleagues in future . 
the Council has , in spite of the warnings and the Commission &apos; s Vorhaltungen during the negotiations - stressed a clear Rechtsbruch .

with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) in terms of accession to the ten applicant countries need to take this view of the ELDR Group in their preparations have completed and needs of each country individually . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria , no doubt that the European Parliament on many occasions . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen that even the countries in which he himself most deficits , including Latvia , at the time of sufficient fulfil the Copenhagen criteria . 
the warnings of Commissioner Verheugen to some candidate countries , the decision of the Commission , six months before the accession of a Comprehensive monitoring Report , the ELDR Group proposed peer review of the new and old Member States in the field of human rights , corruption , administrative capacity and independent financial control ( Amendment No Malmström / Maaten ) , on the Commission the possibility of a few years direct action against the internal market , to take ( the Garantieklauseln ) , and the own-initiative report , Mr Mulder , on the reform of the approval of the agricultural expenditure is therefore of crucial importance . 
Mr President , this chapter 6 I am not one of those who Poland and other countries abstrafen want the Atlantic solidarity of European solidarity preferred . 
each Member State or Government has the right to support the Kriegspolitik Bush or not . 
but it is clear that the majority of the new members of the Union a US and NATO Alliance broader European integration . 
the British Government to bring about the convention on this development . 
in an interview with The Times Peter Hain made it clear that this is an alliance with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe against any shift towards a European superstate . 
the United Kingdom and others will therefore not hesitate to the Intergovernmental Conference , what the outcome of the Convention will confirm its right of veto . 
this veto could any intention , to qualified majority decision-making in areas such as the common foreign and security policy , the budgetary and fiscal policy , the economic and social policy . 
the use of the word &apos; federal &apos; will be verfehmt . 
an appeal to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in judicial decisions for individuals will not be possible . 
Mr President , today , on 9 April 2003 , I voted for the inclusion of Lithuania in the European Union . 
I also hope to the inclusion of a representative of the Lithuanian Pensioners &apos; Party in the European Parliament to support in the defence of the rights of all the elderly throughout Europe .

with such an attitude of the Council has denounced acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
Mr President , I shall now turn to my previous chapters . 
in view of the institutional Nebels that I have just have the enlarged European Union will have to be a single market . 
it is in fact a Freihandelsassoziation as possible , still on the other side of the Atlantic . 
it is interesting that the most supporter of this rash enlargement of the former EFTA-Mitglieder . 
since I do not want the enlarged European Union a of Washington abgesegneten huge market of the rich countries , remains for me to me before reluctantly consenting to decide on the votes on the accession of new Member States abstained on which I warmly welcome but nonetheless welcome . 

Mr President , I voted for Hungary &apos; s accession to the European Union . 
since , in the enlarged Europe at least 200 million pensioners will , I hope that the term Hungary &apos; s own representatives in the European Parliament will allow a proper balance between the number of Members and the number of pensioners in Europe . 
I therefore hope that the Hungarian pensioners a representatives in this Parliament to send so that the interests of the elderly throughout Europe more effectively and with more force can be defended .

. 
I voted today against the request of the Republic of Malta to enter the European Union . 
my decision is the ladder Malta to the Zugvogeljagd . 
Malta had in the accession negotiations strictly refused , the during the European Union ( EU-Vogelschutzrichtline ) in full , and has ensured that a transitional period , the Malta Vogeljagd until the end of 2008 . 
this is a blank cheque for Wilderer and illegal those who sell them . 
hunt High , Singvogeljagd with Schlagnetzen and the mass Abschuss seltenster Singvögel after European Rechtsvorstellungen strictly prohibited . 
a Beitrittsbewerber must recognise this legal basis . 
Mr President , Commissioner . 
it was a difficult decision against the accession of a country to vote in favour , for which I have a very great respect . I have this serious Gewissensentscheidung for me alone . 
I have neither my group is trying to influence , I voted for its influence . 
I can add my voice is not a candidate country , the actively to take troops in an illegal unmoralischen and dirty war in Iraq , by making Völkerrechtsbruch without any hesitation , and the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians supports . 
Poland is on the wrong way and its government , but not only . 
the Polish people have preferred the American Kriegsminister instead of the Polish Pope . 
the Poland are stolzer on their Spezialeinheit GROM than on their Catholic Bischöfe for peace . 
so that they are themselves from the community of values the EU . 
I hope it will soon be back . 
today , after careful thought and in complete agreement with my conscience , I have voted against . 
Mr President , I also hope that in Poland , I voted for the accession of a representative or a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the European Parliament and in this House to support so that I more force for our common defence of the elderly throughout Europe will . 
there are two reasons for my symbolic vote against the accession of Poland . 
the first reason is in the so-called &apos; ethical declaration &apos; , which has been added to the accession Treaties and the position against abortion business and the situation . 
the second reason is that the Polish soldiers on Irak-Krieg , in a demonstration servilen Pro-Amerikanismus and a very vermessenen anti-European attitude . 
I think that I am referring to the hopes and wishes of the proud Polish people , independent country as a member of the European Union and to complete a period in which this great , historic country as satellite has been used for the time of the United States and before from Russia and Germany . 
we support the right of Poland , as well as all the other candidate countries to join the European Union . 
but the conditions which make it clear that this country , as are the accession treaty . 
Poland has , for example , is not entitled to subsidies to the same as the countries of the current European Union , although the farmers a large part of its population . 
however , the European institutions to subsidise their capitalist agriculture , so that they profits abwirft , as the poor farmers of Eastern countries to help live on their work . 
furthermore , the Polish workers , despite all the legal Kopfstände seven years before they come and work in the Union . 
it is also unacceptable that the Union , which is so demanding that the working classes in that country victims demands are appearing before the Polish Church concessions . 
the European Union accepted not only the freedom of women beeinträchtigende Abtreibungsverbot , of all , that the relevant Polish legislation by the Community can be changed , and so that the Polish women in which , under the thumb of a particularly reactionary Church !

I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my colleagues in future .

. 
I will justify my &apos; no &apos; to the accession of the Republic of Poland , at the moment , the European Union so that Poland and one candidate country actively with Elitesoldaten in a völkerrechtswidrigen war , which is currently in Iraq . 
- ( NL ) in terms of accession to the ten applicant countries need to take this view of the ELDR Group in their preparations have completed and needs of each country individually . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria , no doubt that the European Parliament on many occasions .

Mr President , bearing in mind that , in Slovenia of the Pensioners &apos; Party , on behalf of the DeSUS - which , in the government of the country is involved , I hope that your desire . I hope that they own representatives in this Parliament can send the pensioner , not only Slovenia , but all the countries of the new 2004 arising from the EP-Wahlen Europe on a massive presence of defenders of the interests of older people can support from the pensioners &apos; parties that exist all these countries , including Slovenia , sources .

- ( NL ) As a member of the delegation for relations with Slovakia , I know about the problems of this country more so than on the other candidate countries . 
I note that unsustainable political parties and that the economy largely collapsed with the result of massive unemployment in the East and that the successive governments are not prepared to the members of national minorities earlier angetanes wrong ? 
the re-division in the provinces of the fact is that , on the southern edge of Slovakia ungarisch discussed and the vast majority of the local population that ungarisch administration and education . 
the majority of members of the Roma-Bevölkerungsgruppe occupied villages are still in the East , a Slovak elite , a Alleinanspruch on Straßenbeleuchtungen , to have Wasserwerke and gardens . 
perhaps , many people in Slovakia for , in the neighbouring Vienna work . 
with the inclusion of Slovakia imported the EU environmental problems of nuclear installations and the Donau-Staudamms . 
however , is the accession of Slovakia internally divided far more controversial than in the neighbouring countries Poland and the Czech Republic , in which the majority will soon be in the context of a referendum may will vote against it . 
various groups who would like to see this accession improvements . 
on 5 September 2001 , I fear , that they be disappointed , but I respect your decision . 

once again , the vote on the calendar of the European Parliament in 2004 by Straßburg-Gegnern had been mislead the Anwesenheitszeit in this city . 
and as the last time this vote , contrary to the Treaty , because of the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions is that 12 sittings in Strasbourg . 
a reduction on 11 meetings is traditionellerweise in Wahljahren acceptable . 
but this time , the anti-Strasbourg actually went even further , they will only 10 meetings . 
this result is as a absurd machinations of the Party of European Socialists , to remove the last April , so as not to work on 1 May . 
there is still blatant when it states that the calendar 2004 adopted for the implementation of 5 Minitagungen in Brussels , which could be included in theory only if the 12 normal plenary part-session in Strasbourg . 
we call on the French Government , the Court of Justice oppose this illegal vote , because the European Parliament is not a sovereign Parliament , but has only on the him with the Treaty and has special powers of the Treaty . 


in view of the special importance of 1 May as Internationaler day of the workers for us it is not in question , the day in the European Parliament . 
the rest of the timetable , which affects us , and we have no special position . 
in accordance with their political line is opposed this year each of the UEN Group is in the long term , the number of the plenary part-session in Strasbourg should be reduced . 
in recent years , various lobby groups are always tried , through a variety of activities of the final transfer of the seat of Parliament in Strasbourg to Brussels achieve - I am thinking particularly of the reduction in the plenary part-session to four days or the increase in the extraordinary meetings in Brussels - to realise the UEN Group in respect of the Treaties spirit and letter in which the implementation of 12 sittings each year in Strasbourg . 


it is customary in Wahljahren a part-session in Strasbourg on Fridays , but , at the same time , we must astonished to note that the number of extraordinary meetings remains unchanged . 
this situation is quite anormal for 2004 , and I have proposed two additional part-sessions in order to remove under the laws of the zwölfte Strasbourg part-session again . 
it is obvious that , so that everyone its responsibility . 
for us things are clear : for Strasbourg must not to the rank of a simple Außenstelle from Brussels herabgestuft ; it is and must the headquarters of the European Parliament . 
in its vote on the calendar for 2004 , our House just ten part-sessions in Strasbourg . 
the Treaties and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is clear that the calendar of part-sessions of Parliament &apos; s annual twelve or Wahljahren eleven plenary part-session in Strasbourg , must before the inclusion of additional Minisitzungen in Brussels to be considered . 

therefore , is missing in the election year 2004 calendar adopted a Strasbourg part-session , not to mention the absurdity of a votes on an anonymous basis , with the day , in which the European Parliament , the accession Treaties of the new Member States , from the Strasbourg part-session , on the Members of the Member States should be welcomed . 
in view of the fact that the outcome of the European Parliament is illegal , the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group President Pat Cox that the relevant conclusions and the outcome of altogether . 
it calls for the urgent need to convene the Conference of Presidents , so as quickly as possible a new , with the law konforme vote to be added . 
. ( DA ) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report , because we believe that it is necessary to guarantee a fair treatment of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the country . 
in principle , however , we are of the opinion that these rights best national legislation of the Member States to be regulated , although they are from , but a democratic legitimacy . 
we are also aware that the proposal is an area subject to Title IV of the Treaty Establishing and does not apply to Denmark , cf. the protocol on the position of Denmark . 

in spite of the votes against the MPF-Abgeordneten and a large section of the rights of the European Parliament has just the report Cerdeira Morterero , the Commission &apos;s proposed directive on family reunification and many erweiternde proposes changes . 
with these amendments , particularly the definition of family members , the reuniting families , extended the option of this right from the applicant speeded up and Ablehnungsmöglichkeiten for the Member States . 
in our view , there was the original Commission proposal has been very badly , both his principle and in its arrangements . 
this is the outcome of the Council . 
even if it is the European Parliament amendments into account ( because this is in this matter consultees ) , the Council , when it is the principle of a system of family reunification at European level , it is a dangerous mechanism in place . 
it is obvious that the Commission and its allies in future with their common heedlessness and its lack of wirklichem sense of the European interests constantly to the constant this so-called right for enlargement . 
we are , of course , the polygamy and the repression of the for women . 
we accept , however , that under the pretext that one of the wives already living in the host country , the other entry and residence be denied . 
under the pretext of moral principles is merely another obstacle to the immigration and personal relations . 
although we reject such a limit in principle , we have voted for the amendment of the derogations , at least in the case , if the Kindeswohl it requires . 

furthermore , the amendments we have with demütigendem nature , such as the use of DNA-Tests against the immigrants or the argument of public health , which is based on the selfish attitude , medical aid , the European countries can provide , to refuse people who do not have access to them . 
once again , the proposals , the clear progress which are not binding , and the report as a whole does not help to national legislation upwards each other , but downwards . 
. ( DA ) We have decided , our group to and for the motion for a resolution in the report Morterero to vote in favour of it . 
but we are aware that the resolution circumstances , the Title IV of the EC Treaty and therefore does not apply to Denmark , cf. the protocol on the position of Denmark . 
. ( PT ) We are all aware of the gulf between the Tampere Summit statements and the content of this proposal for a directive , aware of the us now , after more than three-year advice in the Council and two amendments to the original proposal the Commission . 
it was stated that a policy of integration should be aimed at migrants &apos; rights and duties of granting with those of the citizens of Europe . 
this text is in the opposite direction . 
the result of differences of opinion within the Council is in line with this proposal Community standards , the &apos; bottom-up &apos; to the lowest common denominator ones , and , with a reduzierenden exposition of the concept of &apos; relatives and many derogations , so that a number of key points remain unresolved . 
that is why we support the proposals in this report , the term &apos; members &apos; wishes , the principle of non-discrimination and the lifting günstigerer legislation . 
on our initiative , the report now provisions , the examination of the authorities not to impose their normal workload and the subjective concept of a long-term relationship . 
should be banned in addition , the incidence of illness or disabilities for issuing residence reason for refusal of a renewal of residence . 
with the introduction of these amendments contrasts quality of the report from the original proposal and therefore deserves our support . 
I would like to my colleague , as I am a member of the intergroup &apos; anti-racism &apos; , for her work on the important and difficult issue of family reunification . 
I voted for this report and I support it in the light of my previous work in the field of immigration , I am particularly secondary migration issues . these include , amongst other things , in the United Kingdom provisions , Ehepaare of different nationalities must prove that the main purpose of the Eheschließung not immigration . 
it is important that the Member States of the entry of close relatives as parents and Ehe- or Lebenspartnern , if this is not for their own needs . 
the implementation of the directive should not mean that the current level of protection granted by the various Member States . 
. 
( PT ) The immigration is a serious problem which , in a realistic and responsible reaction from the Community institutions . 
if no appropriate and balanced measures in this field , then it is precisely the harmful effects , which all European citizens . 
the least during these serious and is now widely recognised problems must be done , it is not to further deteriorate . 
as Commissioner António Vitorino said quite clearly , should be noted that the absorption capacity of the European cities borders . 
perhaps you can see the issue of immigration cannot solve that caused the right to family reunification . 
I think that is quite clear , because I do not deny the importance of this approach . 
but we can and must be the right to family reunification is serious , without its raison d &apos; être . 
in the report and the resolution on this directive has been a different approach in which this right irrationally subsidised to extend the circumstances , no family relations . 
this linksgerichtete irresponsibility serves only to distrust and the resistance against a natural right . 
for all these reasons , I am obliged , to vote against the report . 
that concludes the vote . 
( the sitting was suspended at 14.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. ) 
the next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0111 / 2003 ) by Mr Morillon , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur - priorities and weaknesses . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as we six months before the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , our Parliament to work on this report , we do not began ahnten that it is in such a tragic and distressing time would be submitted . 
the aim was the updating of the previous report by Mrs Catherine Lalumière , the necessary , because the events of September 2001 should be taken into account and a contribution to the work of our fellow Members of the convention wanted to make . 
a some European security and Verteidigungsstruktur at a time when we consider to be feared because , after all , it is at least temporarily quite breakdown , as the fact that it may seem . 
my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , as it were to agree on 25 March this year , in the crisis , the report adopted tomorrow , to the vote in Parliament . 
there are , in my view , at least three reasons . 
firstly , we have a responsibility to our electorate . 
the second is the knowledge that the current crisis us on the eve of enlargement as a lesson we must serve . 
finally , the third reason is that we want a clarification of the policy of the transatlantic cooperation , which the Member States that wish to continue , with many of us hope that the current differences of opinion seem more serious than they are . 
the first is the responsibility to our electorate . 
for all of us are Eurobarometerumfragen indicates that for years , a majority of two thirds of the European citizens have a common security and defence policy . 
as our fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , the atmosphere are aware , it was only natural that they should be in a similar level . 
this was the case in the vote in committee , after a full debate , when it comes to almost 200 amendments . 
under our new Rules of Procedure would be a simple vote in Parliament have been possible , but given the importance of this issue we were unanimous agreement of the opinion that the present debate is justified , we are also the Council and the Commission . 
in this debate , we attached great importance , and this is my second point - without further delay learn the lessons of the current crisis . 
Europe was not in the situation in the United Nations Security Council to speak with one voice , according to the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty its duty . 
this is not proof , Mr President-in-Office , that it is now time to change our institutions , in future the confusion and Kakophonie to prevent the slowly , but I hope only temporarily - in the coexistence of the Member States have made a ? 
as you know , the citizens , as I said , but perhaps more throughout the world that Europe has its place in the construction of a multipolar political world , in order to prevent the fate of our planet is still on the shoulders of the President of the United States . 
I now come to my third and most important point . 
Europe is prepared to take the responsibility , as it is expected of it ? 
I am not sure . 
the decision before it is today , in any case , clearer than ever before . 
either the Member States such as the cold war to its defence alone the forces of the United States . 
in this case the Americans can hardly lessons , such as Washington use these forces . 
they accept what the United States have always of them , i.e. the burden to share , which is , of course , a major contribution to the combined efforts . 
NATO Secretary-General , Lord Robertson , recently in your presence , Commissioner Patten , on the gap between the governments of Europe declared ambition and means that they are prepared for their implementation . 
he described this as the gap of ambition . 
I hope that the current crisis to help them this gap aware of and , with their eradication . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament , the recent crisis in Iraq has quite clearly what Europe is lagging behind , especially in the field of foreign affairs and defence . 
let us not , however , in the weaknesses of Europe . 
this crisis can also be a creative effect on the European policies , and that is why I believe that the report Morillon very timely , even if this his drafting do not yet . 
in the present time , we must , as the old system of the existence of two superpowers collapsed , new security policy strategies and measures . 
given the fact that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is not the only Krisenherd . 
this is not the only risk to global security and stability are being threatened . 
grassierende poverty , organised crime , institutionalised violence and serious economic crises are equally damaging to the global stability and security effect as military or terrorist activities . 
of course we have to look at how and when we look at these risks in the right policy measures . 
in addition to all of us elected response , we think it is absolutely essential that the global security on mutual trust , cooperation and the consensus in international organisations , pushing and networks . 
the method which we deal with threats to global security , our future , if we are building peace and a healthy economic environment ensure and convincing answers to global political , economic and ecological problems . 
I should like to say , with a view to Irak-Krise , I am delighted that the extremely interesting report by General Morillon the Presidency has given the opportunity of the views of the Council to a for European integration subject as important as the European security and defence policy is to say . 
the report Morillon and others appropriate initiatives , as the report , Mr Barnier , have offered us valuable ideas , especially in the for the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled debate , but also at the moment , can be of use , since the competent authorities of the Council &apos; s draft documents which the integration of the ESVP-Mechanismus . this applies also , of course , for the convention . 
I should like to point out here , and I declare the same why that some of the report Morillon basic ideas initiatives , which has already launched and by the competent bodies of the Union . 
I will in the debate on the current threats to safety , stability and peace , the from different than in the past well-known threats . 
the ESVP-Mechanismus was to tell the truth , not from the outset , horizontal and irrational threats , as terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , that is why the mechanism careful and gradually to the current security environment must be adapted . 
consequently , were the first steps , concrete targets : the use of the forces of the Union for the protection against terrorist attacks on the civilian population , on the one hand , and their use in war zones , on the other . 
there is no doubt that the development and the improvement of the military capabilities of the cornerstone of security and hence the defence of the Union . 
we devote special attention to this subject matter , and in the context of the continuation of the so far , efforts is planned , a conference on the ability to convene in implementing the appropriate action plan , the ECAP , progress and to assess again and to decide how to further moved forward . 
the presidency has produced a text contains the guidelines , according to the conclusion of the work of the relevant working parties , the ECAP-Panels , to do . 
we hope that these initiatives , a new impetus to our operational capacity in the military sector to improve and also to help the bases for the further development of ESDP . 
in this respect , it is of particular importance to the rapid reaction force , and this subject of the Spanish Presidency in the priorities in the field of military aspect of the ESDP . 
the operational framework of the establishment and operation of the rapid reaction force , by the competent political and military authorities , and we do any effort , until the end of the Greek presidency to complete . 
it goes without saying that the strengthening of the military capabilities of the Union will only be possible if we Rüstungsbereich and our cooperation . 
this would , of course , has already planned , but now is the time , it is implemented , and the European Union sets foot in this new . 
the decision of the European Council is in two parts : firstly , the Council , the role of the Verteidigungsforschung and the development of these capabilities of the Union in a broader framework to be monitored and , secondly , the possibility of setting up a European Rüstungsagentur , an intergovernmental European authority . 
these two projects are important steps towards strengthening cooperation on defence . 
the Verteidigungsforschung can , in future , with the policies of the European Union in terms of competitiveness with so many sectors with appropriate evidence and promote the development and enlargement . 
with the same intention is also the development of a comprehensive Weltraumpolitik of the Union , which also Sicherheitssektor has to be implemented , and also in the report Morillon has been raised . 
the developments in the last decade , makes it clear that there are many joint risks , and we need a coordinated joint response . 
for this reason , it is necessary to have a common information system security policy and encourage the creation of a system of common political and military training for crisis management of the presidency is of interest , and we have been working . 
the report Morillon said idea of a civil peace corps , is a very good idea , especially as this will help the European average citizen aware of what is happening in the Sicherheitssektor and how we deal with practical level and . 
we consider this idea carefully , and the presidency will probably a draft with the relevant guidelines . 
a basic element of European security is certainly the relationship between the Union to NATO . 
the European option in crisis management is first of all , in any case , the will and the Handlungsbereitschaft of regional and international organisations to call , in other words , the dialogue has priority . 
the recent agreement on cooperation between the European Union and NATO is an important step towards mutual supplement and support the two organisations . 
I would like to use this opportunity to say , in the report by Mr Morillon , to emphasise that the activities of the two organisations and its members of the principles of the United Nations Charter determined and must be done . 
ladies and gentlemen , as I have already said , these points , both in the report , Mr Morillon , as well as the objectives of the presidency , and that is why we are endeavouring to it . 
however , there is no doubt that the report covers a wide range of ideas , which is very important questions and institutional aspects of the ESDP , so that a remarkable contribution to our debate . 
I do not intend to go into all this in the report containing ideas , despite the fact that many of them very interesting . for the implementation of these ideas , institutional reforms , which is currently in the context of the convention and then discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference to be addressed . 
however , I am sure that it is a valuable source of inspiration and would be of benefit . 
we are at a crucial moment . 
the European Union has reduce the courageous companies in the enlargement and must , therefore , with a firm step for an extension of its policies , so that it on the basis of other factors than in the past their way to go further . 
the overwhelming majority of Europeans expects this , as Mr Morillon in his report . 
the time require actually Entschlussfähigkeit and Handlungswillen , with the objective in the defence identity of the European Union . 
this will allow the European Union to strengthen their safety and its foreign policy . 
ladies and gentlemen , the current situation , despite the dark side , the start of a intensive discussion , which the European Union from now on will do , especially now that we in the middle of an open debate on the future of Europe . 
these questions are still not been clarified , and what lessons we also from the reasons and the development of the Irak-Krise may be , we must , so that we in the future similar situation and try and Europe in the global system can give greater weight . 
Mr President , I would like to start by General Morillon very warmly on his comprehensive - and in any case highly topical , the debate on the development of the European security and defence policy . 
on the topical , both I and honourable friend , as the Minister of the Council Presidency rightly pointed out . 
the number of amendments , with which the Committee before the adoption of this resolution has done , is of great interest in many respects , but also the different views on this Schlüsselbereichs of Europe . 
in my own answer , the current competences of the Commission in security and defence issues . 
I will certainly take account of them , and I do not do this , Mr Van Orden to them . 
irrespective of what future recommendations of the convention , which my colleague , Commissioner Barnier the talks on defence issues informed has done - and I know that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy during the discussions on this report has informed - the competences of the Commission is currently in relation to the many in this text issues dealt with very limited . 
the Commission is not at purely military aspects of the European security and defence policy . 
this is only the Member States . 
that is why I will not on the specific military proposals , such as the setting up constantly einsatzbereiter forces , the inclusion of a clause to the collective defence or the creation of a common Militärakademie . 
in the Treaty , the Commission will , however , in conjunction with the ESDP - Article 27 contains a clear reference - and we are actively involved in all the discussions on operations of crisis management of the CFSP , particularly as regards the instruments for civil conflict management , for example , policing , strengthening the rule of law and civil administration and protection . 
in this context , I am pleased to say that the resolution we have before us sends the importance of civil and military contributions to crisis management . 
however , it is not possible - and this point , I have on several occasions in this House - purely military aspects raised by attendant problems , for which we in the Commission is responsible and which we have a real contribution to make . 
military and non-military aspects are not in any dissociate different . 
and they should it , because they must serve a strategy , which are closely coordinated . 
the Commission can , for example , the support of the police forces , following conflicts , such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the European Union on 1 January the take over from the UN has accepted ; or we could look at the training of Grenzschützern in regions , which uncontrolled Massenmigration to conflicts . we could also , as in the past , in the Balkans and topical in Afghanistan , the reconstruction of administrative structures in countries , which is a conflict behind . 
the Commission has already have a wide range of instruments and Fachkenntnissen in crisis situations which can be used . 
as General Morillon said , could new instruments of the European Union security as necessary . 
but the most important precondition is that all available instruments in any situation to implement agreed political objectives of the European Union should be used . 
I must say that the current events show that this is not the case . 
another area in which the Commission has an important role to play , relates to the strategy for Rüstungsfragen . 
I think that can and should be Rüstungshandel and -produktion within the internal market is not a &apos; closed Jagdgründe &apos; . 
the procurement of Wehrtechnik competition between Rüstungsfirmen , research and development , education and imports of Verteidigungsgütern , aspects of the Rüstungshandels and talking about dual-use goods , on a civilian and military use available , these are all areas in which the advantages of the internal market for the European industry are important . 
this is still room for improvement . 
the Commission recently adopted a communication to the Council and Parliament for Verteidigungsgüterindustrie adopted it refers to a number of areas in which fundamental progress made possible by the taxpayers in the European Union a greater added value for their in the safety of that money . 
the concerns about the Duplizierung and fragmentation of production and procurement arms and a lack of interoperability , in the next resolution will be raised - some of the key issues to which we want to mention our communication . 
our hope is that we continue with the follow-up to the communication which can assist , a strong and competitive defence industry , transparent market conditions and a climate is conducive to investment in the for a strengthening of the ESDP necessary research and development projects . 
ultimately , the credibility of the common foreign and security policy in large part of the military capacity of the European Union . 
the creation of a 60 000 men strong &quot; Rapid Reaction Force &apos; in the context of the ESDP is certainly a strengthening of European credibility abroad . 
furthermore , the adoption of the first Militäroperation of the European Union in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last month , that the ESDP not merely a theoretical structure . 
however , I agree with my friend General Morillon entirely that our allies still difficult , Europe seriously if we do not invest more in our security . 
the argument that Europe have its share of costs , by a large proportion of global development funds , even if it is true - or by the humanitarian aid further aufstockt is not enough . 
we also have a more in the development of our spheres of operation in the form of Lufttransportkapazitäten , special teams and Gefechtskommunikationstechnik . 
if we do not do this , then we will continue to our allies of the opinion that Europe his Friedensdividende after the fall of the Berlin wall has to make quickly . 
the challenge of aid organisations should remain in the provision of aid , the neutrality , independence and impartiality such humanitarian operations . 
a respect for these principles is for the humanitarian needs in essential . 
this is why the Commission welcomes the fact that the report on the guidelines for the deployment of military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten within the framework of humanitarian UN-Operationen in complex emergencies , on 20 March 2003 published by the UN . 
it is clear rules on the relationship between military and humanitarian operators in humanitarian UN-Operationen . 
the Hauptaussagen the guidelines for the use of European military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten in humanitarian operations . 
I would like to make one last comment about the humanitarian law , the military action . 
we believe that humanitarian law to the conflicts in the present time , provided that the Kriegsparteien and all the signatories of the Geneva Convention , with their obligations . 
I would like to point the recognition of the Commission with regard to the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross as subsidiary parties and guardians of the Geneva Convention . 
finally , I would like to my honourable friend once again that this report on almost painful way is topical . 
it raises a number of issues which are directly affect our credibility in Europe , and if we take the effort in the coming years a greater contribution in international affairs . however , as I said on previous occasions in this House said a moment , in the policy that his into reality . 
in relation to security this time we have already been long exceeded . 
Mr President , in connection with Commissioner Patten , I should like to say that the report of Mr Morillon , in fact , exactly the right time , be made . 
in recent weeks was indeed the de facto powerlessness of the European Union and the various Member States together in the area of defence a much role to play . 
the criticism of the United States , America should not act as Weltpolizist sounds basically strange from the those who , even in the situation and , in fact , often are not prepared . 
at the time , we have , in particular , the experiences in Yugoslavia , where the European countries from &apos; Friedfertigkeit &apos; and &apos; modesty &apos; they commented publicly , but from &apos; cynicism &apos; and &apos; indifference &apos; . 
this hypocrisy is gradually from this Parliament have disappeared . 
we all have , in my opinion , clearly understood that Europe responsibility in the defence cultures and that , in any way whatsoever , has said . 
I hope it will actually happen . 
only on the organisations of the European Union and in cooperation with the transatlantic partners , it is possible , this task . 
these two must always in a breath . 
they are closely linked component . 
the stronger the transatlantic trust , the greater the internal coherence of the European Union . 
in this area in the European Union often divisions depends , i.e. it with our attitude to the USA , our transatlantic partner . 
this is the combination of these two very important element in the report by General Morillon . 
it is a realistic way to a European Verteidigungsverantwortung , because of its experience as a general knows that military action in the first and then necessary civil actions buried as they are . 
in view of the now raubend and plündernd from the roads Bagdads ziehenden Mobs is fully aware of this . 
in addition to a successful concluded action must therefore immediately to take civil level . 
the decision on such a cautious , realistic way is , for example , by common research and development , through a common definition of the from a European perspective military needs . 
this is , of course , always a new departure , and in many countries , it is difficult for us to move on , but it is of the utmost importance . 
for the production , this is extremely important . 
this is the effectiveness of the Verteidigungsanstrengungen considerably improved . 
if the search for a European perspective of the responsibility which we in the area of defence , our starting point , can the confidence of all the Member States . 
no one is in order to respond to the question put to the large country is now nachgefolgt : France , Germany , Great Britain , and the United States . 
it is essential that we in the European Union a common European position in Militärangelegenheiten . 
this is the report by Mr Morillon a unmissverständlicher impulse . 
he acted so that , in fact , a already recommended by Commissioner Patten , namely the borders of the method adopted by the Treaties opportunities to capital . 
it will examine thoroughly and you come at a brick wall , then we do , to which , as a reform must be and what institutional changes to decide . 
I personally believe that this has always been a very practical way , General Morillon has also decided . 
for a European Verteidigungsverantwortung , the prospects for , of course , still not particularly helpful . 
the developments , which we have seen recently , have shown that the Member States and the members of the Council itself not a very sensible idea of the Council . 
otherwise , would , for example , the Greek presidency currently in this area initiatives taken by a far greater role to play . 
we must not to the possibility of Auseinanderfallens of the European Union in two groups , each with a closer cooperation . 
in short , it is incredibly important that the European defence at the request of the citizens , as General Morillon writes that reality . 
this is a more efficient use of the budget , and this is all the citizens directly to success . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , two years after the report , which I had the honour of this House at the same subject , I am expressing today with pleasure that I support the report by Mr Morillon . 
after the adoption , as we hope , some of our group has tabled amendments to the adoption of the motion for a resolution well without difficulties to be arranged . 
I shall therefore limit myself to a number of points , which is in the context of this very turbulent spring 2003 is particularly important . 
in this context is not good for the fledgling European security and defence policy , ESDP . 
since 11 September 2001 , the European Union is in political and military terms , largely being sidelined , be it in the Afghanistan- or Irakfrage or with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
yet we are not reduced to zero , but it is in civil and humanitarian actions . 
this is important , but not enough . 
far worse , however , is that in this period within the Union . 
despite the commendable efforts of the Greek presidency , the adoption of joint positions , are opinions in the Irakfrage , both in terms of the kind of our transatlantic relations and our Grades of autonomy to the United States , as a corollary - with regard to certain fundamental principles of the use of violence , the importance of international law or the role of the United Nations . 
in spite of this dark situation loud and clear , I would like to express my conviction that , under no circumstances should fail . 
some countries - Germany , France and Belgium , Luxembourg , have already initiative , the security and defence policy to relaunch . 
Greece , which holds the Unionsvorsitz has responded positively , as the Prime Minister Simitis recently stated . 
I hope that the convention , with its chairman Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing after a few weeks of secrecy and hesitation in this issue , too , proposals . 
excellent ideas on the institutions of the foreign , security and defence policy are already by Mr Dehaene , Mr Barnier has , moreover , with the views expressed by Parliament . 
today , the report , Mr Morillon , a number of interesting proposals , for example , to the objectives of the CFSP and the ESDP under the new international situation , to the new role of NATO , the relations between the European Union and NATO , the military capabilities , particularly high-tech patenting activity which we simply need to be credible . 
of course , it is not a question of compete with the United States . 
this would be unwise and totally impossible . 
it is certain is simple situations . 
because of its geographical proximity and its common borders are the countries of Europe security effectively together . 
because of its traditions , particularly in cultural point of view , they have important values and principles in the world . 
finally , the Europeans because of its resources and the economic instruments which they have created in a position to spread its ideas and their interests , if necessary , throughout the world to defend themselves when they only the will of this . 
in short , we Europeans have quite simply a role to play in the world , without this control , but without any policies and without a whatever sort Untertänigkeitsverhältnis . 
Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , do you ! 
this is the desire of Parliament , which will support you . 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Morillon regrets that at the beginning of the debate . 
this report could not be more topical . 
if , as is probably - the American and British forces now , the control of Baghdad , then the debate on the effects of war and to ziehenden lessons from the start . 
in contrast to its predecessors shows that the current government only minor interest in a strong and unified Europe . 
our weakness is cruelly bloßgelegt , and it is the duty of the EU , a Sicherheitsstrategie to develop in the transatlantic relations help . 
the Members of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party in this House welcome the report by Mr Morillon as an important contribution to this process . 
the European differences of opinion on the subject of Iraq have made it clear that we are not able , in terms of security issues to speak with one voice , however , we should not forget that Europe on a common trade policy , a joint development policy and on a particularly entstehendes diplomatic corps in the form of Kommissionsbüros throughout the world . 
these are powerful instruments , the more powerful , if they as part of an integrated foreign policy linked . 
our foreign policy is incompatible with three Commissioners , the Council presidency and the High Representative of the Council is distributed and because some Member States to deny that we have fundamental common interests in the field of foreign policy , or the Commission , to take a leading role . 
without a common defence policy , it is Europe in the for a credible common foreign policy necessary military influence . 
our common defence budgets to less than half of the expenditure of the United States and make it clear that the EU is not enough investment in the defence of our citizens have higher Verteidigungsetats welcome . 
it not be enough , more to invest : we need the funding more effectively , and especially for fundamental requirements as strategic Lufttransporte , Präzisionslenkwaffen and Tankflugzeuge . 
for this reason , the Liberals support the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency armament and research to control the defence budgets . 
we want to obtain cheaper and , if the EU countries also think that , outside the EU produced arms are able to meet our criteria and the cheapest , then we should not in a fehlgeleiteten Anflug of protectionism European option . 
this is how we repeat the mistakes of the common agricultural policy . 
more must defence budgets with greater decision making . 
Parliament cannot with its clear and unanimous message in favour of a strong and effective European Security and Defence Policy to the European Convention on the report of General Morillon hope to influence the discussion . 
through the appointment of a single representative for Foreign Affairs , the Commission , but additional resources and expertise from the Member States , we will be a great deal of progress on the approximation of grundverschiedenen elements in the field of foreign and security policy . 
we also have a greater flexibility in the introduction and implementation of crisis management of the and if necessary , in which the constructive abstention . 
there are clear reservations about this , but the introduction of a clause to the collective defence in the new constitution-treaty , similar to that of the Treaty on the Western European Union , the clause is also necessary . 
this may not immediately progress with all 15 Member States , with 25 Member States . 
I therefore welcome the initiative of the Belgian government , in this month met with France , Germany and Luxembourg to issues of defence policy . 
progress of European integration can often only by the firm commitment to a group of determined countries , which is a matter moving and then other countries . 
nevertheless , I strongly believe that enhanced cooperation on defence issues all the governments to want to continue should be open and that the British Government in particular , due to their military capabilities and experience will . 
finally , I would like to point out that a European security and defence policy by NATO guaranteed collective Sicherheitsstruktur supplement , as long as there is a rationalisation of the Rüstungsbeschaffung , added value in the form of a doctrine on the basis of conflict prevention and crisis management and a creditable threatened use of military measures and a more coherent and common approach to the security policy . 
let us of our Security and Defence Policy , on the Amboss of hope and from the steel our ashamed with a view to Iraq . 
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Morillon , at the beginning of his report , as the guiding principle of the European foreign and security policy . 
in its considerations , he says - in my opinion , and rightly so - that the crisis must be the guiding principle . 
only in emergency situations , only in crisis situations of the European Union on military resources . 
this is precisely the order of my group supports and that is why we are also in favour of , for example , the use of the European Union in Macedonia and Bosnia . 
this means that the European Union , finally , I would say , on the were last funds in the Gesamtspektrum of foreign and defence policy instruments . 
in addition to the diplomacy , in addition to economic resources now military resources , but if you please this order . 
I would like to highlight two chapters of the report . 
first of all , the General - in my opinion rightly - by means of an amendment proposed that a certain point to the already contained in his report , as yet , namely the need for a strategic approach . 
what are the specific objectives of the European security policy ? 
where do we want ? 
what we need this ? 
when we want to do this ? 
such an approach , I believe that this is an excellent report . 
I am also outright advocates a review of the Petersberg tasks , so that the official description of our in my opinion , far too limited strategic approach . 
I am , however , then , to begin and then only for the territorial defence to discuss , and in the report by Mr Morillon , in my view , only volatile comments . 
this is now suddenly to the tasks of the European Union to be added ? 
we need to Article 5 of the WEO-Vertrags ? 
such a decision is premature . 
first of all , we should deal with the strategic approach and then to consider what these European instruments should be achieved . 
similarly , I think it would be too early to say that in the year 2009 should we be able to a task as in Kosovo . 
it is the examination of the strategic concept and then the adoption of these specific tasks . 
secondly , another important point of the report which often existing misunderstanding , although , as well as the contributions of Mr Patten and Mr Watson a little angeklungen - said that we are not sufficient financial resources for the vorzusehenden actions . 
the problem , ladies and gentlemen , is not that too little money is available , but that it is not enough and efficient enough and that it has to be used in a Arbeitsspezialisierung lacking . 
where the problem lies . 
let us . 
I am pleased that this is also in the report by Mr Morillon expressed clearly . 
with regard to the funding - begrüßenswerterweise I support the rapporteur - gradually transferring the funding of , in my opinion , completely non-transparent national Ad-hoc-Haushalten between Member States , the any democratic control of the EU budget . 
there are many arguments as to whether it is only the impact on the European defence policy , the European Parliament finally in this respect , as the defence spending from the Community budget . 
finally , I would like to a point of my main concern . 
in this Parliament , and also with the Council , we are agreed that the effectiveness of should be increased . 
we must be able to act quickly and efficiently . 
I agree , ladies and gentlemen , but if you please on the basis of a specific strategic plan . 
my fear is that a fundamental Zubehör , namely the democratic control , are missing . 
a further increase the effectiveness and improve our potential without clarity about where the security democratically controlled , is not possible . 
if we are in favour - and the majority of Parliament that qualified majority voting in the area of security policy , then we must support - in exercising democratic control of the European Parliament cannot be excluded . 
effectiveness is necessary , but if you please , together with democratic control , and this must ultimately here in this Chamber . 
Mr President , the recent international events have once again shown how urgently a European Union , of the need for closed action is capable of both if it is to defend their own safety , and , if need be , the right of each people to the pursuit of a democratic , pluralist safeguarding human and civil rights wahrenden system to protect ; a Europe that the diplomacy - the diplomatic services - and the provision of each Member State can bring together those cooperation , which the Council , the need for our eyes , always with the problems of the world politics , in order to reach decisions to be able , as far as possible the whole Union . 
it is primärer importance , the whole of the foreign and security policy debate and the resulting ableitenden decisions in the framework of the Council . 
it is also of primärer importance of a single European representative for these two areas . 
with this issue is also the convention . 
indeed , the number of Member States outside of the Council meetings are held , legitimate initiatives , but they are not initiatives of the European Union . 
that is why it is obvious that we have a European security and defence policy , which is also a military instrument as proposed by Mr Morillon peace and democracy , can guarantee supported . 
these European forces to be the national forces of all the Member States will arise , and also to the development of citizenship an extra impetus , because this is Inter alia from the proud feeling that every citizen of its belonging to his country and the European Union must are : free and independent European Union , winner of a project of peace and mutual respect for the rest of the world , a project which not only on the basis of documents , noble declarations of intent or the production of trade relations are based , but with proper powers for the fight against terrorism and the defence of our values of our vision of the world where freedom and our institutions . 
Mr President , it is always the same . 
if the European Chimären the reality of transgresses , then we will develop &apos; europabewegten &apos; Träumer to new and even absurdere ideas , both in a headlong , the ridiculous , would it not dangerous . 
the report , Mr Morillon , we will present the myth of a European defence , in fact , an old hat one can . 
it was already the whole of the twentieth century through the dream of einfältigen Geistern - without any practical results . 
already Aristide Briant widespread this idea with the tragic , the opposition and the Verteidigungsbereitschaft in France . 
in 1948 , this fixe idea at the conference in The Hague , once again aufgetischt and then 1950 by a certain Winston Churchill with the EVG , the from its Träumereien was born and key brake . 
we must also thank the French Parliament , to put an end to it . 
fifty years later , we are still in the same point , in other words , there are no progress has been made . 
we have even as little progress that the key element of a common defence policy , the establishment of a European defence industry - not only is it not progress that has , since , as we can hardly be pointed out , the Europeans most buy weapons with each other but not to approximately 60 % of the United States . 
this would be started if the speech of a defence policy . 
yet this defence policy is a myth because there are no defence policy without a common foreign policy . 
this has been done in 1992 in ehernen credit in title V of the Maastricht Treaty , but it is in any crisis , either in Rwanda , in Afghanistan in Kosovo - even been achieved . 
this is not because we all share the United States blindly hinterherliefen . 
and now platzt it again , the common foreign and security policy . 
we should no longer these Chimären nachlaufen . 
Europe must be based on the ground . 
and the realities , such as more visible today than ever , the Member States . 
this must not take a crucial components : the will to defence and the necessary resources . 
I will confine myself here , to express the wish that France , which is increasingly global responsibility , will make its own Verteidigungsmittel , because this is the only thing that the best contribution to the what Europe still remains . 
Mr President , with the words of a French Komikers to speak , everything is in all , and vice versa . 
in view of the obvious collective failure of the so-called European Union in areas such as economic growth and employment , the rapporteur , who seem to forget that he General of the French army for a Verteidigungskonzept which quite simply a link France to a level , which is currently - if anything , Belgium will entirely meet ! 
of course , this will tirelessly on all those which , for various reasons the concept of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; the opportunity to see a up against stumbling blocks concerning European unification process to relaunch . 
the war in Iraq , however , should be an opportunity for all these Schöngeister finally to realise that the kaltblütige monster that are to their own interests . 
the recent failure of the European Transportflugzeugs that much more quickly and much less would have to be established , the endless Geschachere the GALILEO project , the extremely high costs for each Rüstungsfabrikation multinational basis , the fate of hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are threatened - all that has no significance for these Berufspolitiker , whose only aim is , as long as possible in power . 
the enlarged Europe needs stability , but this cannot , of course , be achieved by new legal Kunstgriffe , unpraktizierbare cooperation , unfähige organisms , supposed power or Vortäuschungen are . 



whatever our current differences of opinion on the Nahostproblematik all Eurosceptic without exception and without reservations this fixe idea of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; . 
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , it has always been my dream , after a de Gaulle to speak , but not for a that such speeches . 
we are now that the debate on the future of European security and defence policy , witness the war in Iraq . we believed that this war with diplomatic means to prevent . 
but we are , because we across the political and military existent because we do not . 
as a war or peace , we were not prepared , once again . 
we too late , as in Bosnia and Kosovo or in Afghanistan . 
in any of these armed conflicts , the European Union as an international player , the mitbestimmt . 
this is one of the Kernsätze of the report Morillon that only a Union with clearly defined foreign policy objectives and interests , equipped with effective military capability , that counts . 
just such a Union can a self-employed player in world politics and a selbstbewusster partners in the transatlantic relations . 
there is now so many head of government , given its powerlessness in the Irak-Krieg thinks that it is now öffentlichkeitswirksam the objective of a European Verteidigungsunion thereof . 
I wonder whether this government not to the decisions taken since Helsinki in 1999 involved ? 
why did not do more to ensure that the Rapid Einsatztruppe planned 2003 , the EU convincing technologically up-to-date and with the relevant Kommandostrukturen transport and operational ? 
why has the Anpassungsreform their national forces behind the new Sicherheitsherausforderungen back ? 
why are seeing in this way reversed ? 
why did you for the transportation of its own soldiers in their own country to the Flugzeugvermieter Ukraine ? 
the European Parliament has consistently since 1999 , that the foreign policy instruments of the European Union military capability . 
of course it is now in the convention . 
this report is also the European Parliament &apos; s contribution to the future : how can the European Union to protect the safety of their citizens with new threats by terrorism and how can the European Union to peace and stability in the world ? 
because no legitimacy Präventivkriege we must never again ! 
we therefore support this report all those in the Convention for the updating of the Petersberg tasks , ensure that a vanguard of Member States military Krisenmissionen can assume that the for a kind of European Rüstungsagentur , for a European Beistands- and Solidaritätsklausel and in particular , the main point of majority decision-making in the foreign policy and closer cooperation in the defence policy to introduce . 
we believe , however , that governments should have to be quite clear : millions of people have in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges in the streets of cities of Europe demonstrated in favour of that war and peace , but not Kabinette parliaments to decide . 
whoever facility of a European Einsatztruppe decides needs a very high level of democratic legitimacy . 
let me make one last thought : all future facility in the context of the ESDP will be a civil and military part . 
that is what we are of NATO . 
in Bosnia , we have now with a police mission . 
next year we might resolve the SFOR-Mission NATO . 
we cannot cohesion between civilian and military operations best to ensure , for both the same rules , and the common costs on the budget of the European Union . 
this has to do with parliamentary control , but gain from their governments also democratic support and support for their actions . 
the citizens of the European Union , in any case , already say yes to the report , Mr Morillon &apos; s idea of a European defence policy . 
71 % of the citizens of Europe . 
only the Kabinette have not yet understood . 
Mr President , I would also like to Mr Morillon , on his excellent report , and I can already tell me that it is possible to the objectives and proposals for support . 
as has already been said , the debate to find an appropriate time . 
the war in Iraq , Europe has divided . 
that is why , in the public opinion doubts about the ability of the European Union arose außereuropäischer level , with one voice . 
today &apos;s debate on the European defence policy is therefore a very dubious moment . 
the idea but not silent and , without new initiatives , could not wiedergutgemacht angerichtete damage . 
in the European Convention is now on the strengthening of the Beschlussfassungsstrukturen . 
the report Morillon contains a whole series of practical proposals to improve the Verteidigungsfähigkeit the EU . 
we support the enlargement of the Petersberg tasks , which also include the fight against terrorism . 
the Schnelleingreiftruppe must be more attention . 
when will this be truly independent operations should be possible , it is also a more efficient organisation of the defence industry in Europe . 
in the implementation of all these objectives of the European Union with a useful military capacity . 
the European Union will then have still not a military superpower . 
this is not the intention . 
in the context of a comprehensive policy with the crisis , the European Union , the simultaneous use of several instruments . 
such a plan is a credible military component . 
the Irakkonflikt has bewusster our weaknesses , but this is no reason for complete change of Grundkonzepts . 
the European Union must , together with other countries and multilateral framework within their responsibilities , when it comes to the international legal system . 
the recommendation , the development of foreign and security policy with a vanguard active Member States to speed up deserves support . 
the pace can no longer in principle be determined . 
but I am in favour of an open process . 
who would like to endorse the opportunity to them . 
Mr President , the report Morillon refers to the European defence as part of a realistic and responsible strategy of solidarity and complementarity with the United States and is therefore a strong step forward , perspectives victims , economic and military investment . 
it is a necessary and important step in the new terrorist threats and not be underestimated . 
a Agenda , which is in line with my proposals , which I last year with the study &apos; A European sword &apos; proposals . 
the report avoid dangerous illusion that neither the security and democracy in the world would strengthen the unity of Europe . 
these dangerous illusion the resurgence of a one-sided Pazifismus , a return to the previous unilateral Pazifismus of red &apos; rather than dead &apos; . 
a further illusion is one of Europe , strong and einflussreich , because it is of the United States losgesagt : an illusion , which is the fault of the USA-feindlichen and for the European supranational policy unempfänglichen Gaullismus , especially in the field of foreign and security policy . 
it is an illusion , the deep in the European nationalism and have failed ideologies rooted , an illusion , the strange Rechts-Links-Bündnis in relation to the war in Iraq and , on the other hand , the principle of democratic intervention has magnified . 
these political illusion is more dangerous than the imperiale Unilateralismus and blinde Pazifismus : the right to Europe , he has divided ; he has divided the Fifteen , he has insulted the Eastern European countries , while the Wiedervereinigungsprozess was that he has increased distance from the United States and the opportunity of exercising the right of veto to cripple the Security Council , so that he justifications for the military intervention outside the UN did . 
before the European Union the development of the reallocate institutional system , it must clarify its political vision ; it is the safety of their population , their own territory and its borders ensure , as it in the Balkans failed - it must erosion of Rüstungskontrolle and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to bloody dictatorships to take on board and they must fight against terrorism and for the safety of Israel and the democratic Palestinian State . 
if the Union neither unterwürfige still hostile , either resigned still dependent allies of the United States , it must be a common defence and gradual the leadership of the Atlantic Alliance , in the United States now only 8 % of their armed forces committed . 
in order to do this , the agreement of Saint-Malo between France and Great Britain and this report by Philippe Morillon , as you today the culmination of the development of European security policy , which strengthen , develop and to the whole Union needs to be extended . 
Mr President , we should today , as we speak about the European security and guarantee the future for all of us will be able to make . 
in particular in the last few years and on 11 September , we have seen that military weapons no guarantee of security . 
quite the contrary , we could say that if a country on earth military well equipped , it is the United States on 11 September victims of Terroraktion . 
this terrorist attack by the previous armament could not be prevented . 
the Rechtsruck , in the United States in this area , must heaven forbid the security considerations in Europe . 
there is - globally and within the EU - a complete divergence between the investments in military equipment and our investment in a truly sustainable security . 
the problem is that the report Morillon these abuses not eliminated , as one of the reasons is that I cannot support it in the final analysis , although there are many good and right studies on the need for a European identity in these areas . 
but if they should be identity so that we , as has already been rejected and has proven to be , we are on the wrong track . 
that is not an expression of Pazifismus , because I believe that a nation has the right to defend their own rights , and I also believe that it can be situations where military power to the peace is necessary . 
but the threat that we are not by military means . 
it is primarily the desperation of people in a very unfair world , and we should focus our efforts . 
Madam President , let me begin by thanking Mr Morillon , for the effort which he has done Zusammentragen of different viewpoints . 
Mrs Frahm from my Group has already stated that the report despite its positive content for three reasons not to adopt clear . 
the first reason is our dependence of NATO , a fact that the European Union , together with the American giants as a Zwerg format , and if the European Union wishes to develop , then it needs a specific personality . 
otherwise , there is no future for the European Union . 
the second reason is the need , after the end of the war in Iraq deliberate , because we must make it very clear that the current risk in the world the aggressive behaviour of the United States . 
on 20 September strategy presented by the United States , wars throughout the world . 
next will Syria , Iran , Korea to the number - who knows ? 
I do not want to name in order to suggest . 
it is a major threat of safety . 
my third point is , therefore , the European Union is a fundamental role in the democratic strengthening of the United Nations Security Council and the need to play . 
we must also to the objective , conflicts in accordance with international law , inevitably , the General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council to ensure - and that the United States do not . 
the contribution that the European Union , is a success . 
we are of many countries South America has been said that , despite the - in my opinion , completely unjustified - pressure that the President Aznar has had so that the two countries , the Security Council , the war against Iraq , these dignity and courage way and Europe set an example , peace and law in favour of a more important than the dangerous Abenteuern of the United States . 
Madam President , in his explanatory statement for an EU armed force , General Morillon : if the governments of the Member States retain the Americans , any wars , and only with questions of peace , then the Union must certainly accept that it is the role of the Athens ancient Rome is : is the case in the final analysis , to accept that there is the desire of a new Empire . &apos; 
as I prefer Athens , the cradle of culture and democracy , the separate Rome , which is the enemy of the whole world and , at the end of blood and fire was sinking and the Greek weiterlebt in all areas of the Olympic Games to the EU-Ratsvorsitz . 
general Morillon wants , that the EU is doing the same as the United States in Kosovo , or perhaps in Iraq or in one of the smaller countries , against the United States in the last century Angriffskriege . 
they want to see that the EU in the entire planet while not accepting , particularly in the Balkans , in the Middle East , in the Caucasus in Mittelasien and Africa , by taking military action . 
in such a scenario is , of course , no room for non-aligned countries . 
constitutes a so-called Solidaritätsklausel be attached and a UN mandate is absolutely no longer be necessary . 
if the EU , the Roman way of General Morillon , can it be that a fine day a EU-Präsident alongside the President of the United States discussed in the oil and mineralreichen developing country the poor next time in the Steinzeit zurückgebombt . 
any attempt , in the militärtechnischen area with the United States , but us runs the risk that the lethal arms race of the Soviet Union . 
certainly the Europeans then billion people also attach such as the Americans . 
millions of people will be the EU embassies , the Eiffelturm will be the fate of the World Trade Center , will undermine the UN , the Zivilisationskrieg will spread and the people of Europe , which is still , will be the losers , as many Superwaffen following the example of the United States , we are also move . 
if General Morillon with his views , we have the best book &apos; The sinking of the Abendlandes &apos; of Oswald Spengler from the Regal to understand what will happen . 
if we , as General Morillon which aspires to try to build a modern Rome , it is also the fate of Roms . 
no , we are the plans for a military superpower once and for all we hear our Sacharow-Preisträger ! 
we take the Dalai Lama seriously , our the was . 
the European Union has only as a chance of survival and reject the raison d &apos; être . 
let us a civil peace corps under EU-Regie . 
rather than ridiculous , we should prefer lessons from the experience of the Member States , which 200 years from wars heraushalten . 
the specific characteristics of the European Union is to peace . 
should the United States war , by the Americans themselves sink into blood and fire as the Römer ! 
but let us in the culture and democracy Athens note . 
Madam President , the events of 11 September 2001 , the world , peace and security , no matter . 
in this light , it is good that the countries of Europe , the need to be accepted , even greater responsibility . 
at stake , namely our own credibility and safety . 
by fluctuation is not . 
it is the report Morillon was quite right to the view that , in relation to the collective defence NATO essential bond is still the same time , however , the development of an autonomous European security and defence policy . 
not to mention the wholly inadequate Verteidigungsanstrengungen in Europe . 
in short , the report Morillon shows no clear path . 
what is naheliegender as an adequate contribution of the EU Member States in NATO ? 
one thing is certainly : in connection with Iraq to implement differences between the European members and the controversial initiative of the European defence policy are not help ensure that the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy is currently a credible basis for the safety of our citizens in the countries of Europe . 
these citizens with a unanimous strong NATO . 
Madam President , between the drafting of the report Morillon today are important international developments , the effect that the issues of the defence of Europe will no longer be dealt with globally and a uniform manner . 
we can act as if there is still in the establishment of a common defence policy for the purpose of the implementation of a common foreign and security policy of all the Member States . 
the arguments of the Security Council on effect , then the beginning of a further after the war in Kosovo , this time against Iraq , in violation of the provisions of the Charter of San Francisco are considerable differences demonstrate the between the present and future Member States of the European Union in the field of foreign policy . 
it is patently two Konzeptionen of Europe and its role , two types of foreign policy , two opinions of the international order . 
we must take note of this . 
it would be the wrong way forward if we versteifen would only a circumstances geschuldete crisis which - as soon as they took - would give us back to the old strategies and the return on one essentially little semantic games in connection with the CFSP and the ESDP again . 
in future to everything at Union level , with foreign affairs and defence , only the concept of variable geometry . 
on this in no way fakultativen approach is now more . 
it is a variable geometry , to greater efficiency and less idle chit-chat . 
the convention should now his talents in this respect . 
in the report , Mr Morillon , the proposals which must be seen as representative of the most recent developments completely obsolet , and those who are still effect . 
in the first category , I would especially paragraph 54 that in the proposes that the European Union a permanent seats in the UN Security Council . 
this proposal is clearly contrary to the current needs of Europe , continue to two permanent members of the Security Council , so that the two different Konzeptionen , the two different Hauptwege which the countries of Europe , expression . 
in the second heading in my opinion , the proposals to the necessary cooperation , the first in the field of terrorism , what the consequences of the Irakkrieges still necessary , and , secondly , in the area of production and Kaufes arms must be developed . 
the recent events have to make it quite clear , what damage in Europe , with the ideology of the Friedensdividende . 
I therefore welcome the fact that the concept of Community preference in the report by Mr Morillon in zweckdienlicher ever again , however , I regret that this with his disappearance in other strategically important area also coinciding : the CAP , i.e. the autonomy of food or , at the American terminology - to use the Nahrungsmittelwaffe . 
the supply , as the report Morillon means , for food for supplying arms . 
we must ensure that Commissioner Lamy this in the negotiations of the Doha-Runde not mind . 
Mr President , we know that discussions on a common security and defence policy are for the supporters of the realistic or even überrealistischen school a kind of wishful thinking . 
however , it is precisely in the current circumstances , this report , with its Denkanstößen of all the more interest . 
basically , we can only support this report , because it is based on fundamental arguments on the part of the European Parliament and the citizens of the Union , there is , in particular to respect the principles of the UN Charter and the law , to a framework for the guidelines of the common foreign policy , the European Security and Defence Policy , on the need for us that Europe responsibility in the field of security and defence policy , starting with military assistance for humanitarian Hilfseinsätze , conflict prevention and -lösung to maintain transatlantischer relations and a multilateral approach . 
I would like , however , that the report perhaps too much in the depth and even some details that are not so clearly . 
if , for example , paragraph G the Kriegsrecht mentioned , is not clear whether the Geneva Convention is now criticised or not . 
furthermore , I do wonder at this stage , the question is : should we not more attention to the existing resources to streamline by our efforts , Doppelungen merge and interoperability between the armed forces of our countries ? 
could the sektorenweise distribution of appropriations for the defence in each country . 
some countries , of course , 70 % or more for staff and maintenance . 
it could perhaps a joint contribution to a priority as scientific research modern systems , the usually results both industry and the economy can be of use . 
having said that this is a debate on a very practical matters , which is only right now . 
Madam President , the events of the last time , show that the EU Member States either now or in the future will be able to the organisation of a common defence to come . 
the Member States of the members of NATO , represent quite different views in relation to the Irakkrieg , as far as the general approach of these countries to the new world order , which is emerging . 
this makes it difficult to establish a common defence policy . 
the neutral Member States and do not want that the EU is to become a military alliance or or military superpower . 
under these circumstances it would be sensible if the EU crisis management and the NATO as a system of collective safety for the EU Member States , the organisation of the belong to . 
Germany , France , Belgium and other gleichgesinnte countries could close mutual military cooperation within NATO and a defence community , which is a strong European pillar of the NATO operate . 
this system would cooperation between Europe and North America , which is very important for us all . 
Europe should have been NATO its own defence identity , but the defence community would cooperate closely with the United States . 
the other EU Member States , the members of NATO and the neutral , would have a role to play in the transatlantic link to maintain and consolidate . 
the emergence of a defence community could even turn into a broader internal differentiation within the Union on the basis of considerations , the leading French and German experts and politicians over the years , have made . 
then let different institutions to the heart of the Union , such as the German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has proposed . 
Madam President , I believe that all members of the European Parliament on 18 years , the average age is 40 or 50 , which is why we should not Zinnsoldaten . 
I am not General and this is not , therefore , I have just done my Wehrdienst without the Unteroffizier appointed . 
however , I can , while I am speaking , not the Fotografie on the front page of the newspaper &apos; s &apos; s Guardian of the internal eye , which shows where these conduct preventative wars use . 
and I can also not from my memory , which I five minutes seen on television , namely a people which not only for days bombing , but it is up to the borders of the humiliation do redundant , with plundering , theft and what we in the TV with . 
we here in visitors in these circumstances , journalists , before the interpreters on armament and mechanisms are instead directed our attention to where we are ? 
we can accept paragraph 17 in the &apos; krisenpräventiven nature &apos; military actions , if a preventative war that is what Mr Bush and Blair in Iraq have begun ? 
we cannot approve paragraph 9 , which states that terrorism the idea of geografisch limited military commitments lapses and the traditional distinction between the policy of the external and internal security ironed out ? 
what are we doing ? 
we are opening even wide open the door to a war in Syria in Iran , in North Korea and later , Mr Morillon , in France . 
this is why this is a useful debate . 
to see where we stand . 
not to say that it is bad for us to be divided over . 
to say that what the two sides of the European Union . 
the side of the principles of the Charter in the United Nations Security Council or the injured party , the an action in accordance with the UN has supported ? 
the political basis to analyse , to which the European Union , which is not a real caricature of the United States , but a Pol of peace , the diplomatic services and the restrained action in the 21st century , at any level , the twentieth century equal . 
Madam President , Commissioner , as has been aware that Europe , despite the fact that there is the most important commercial power , only a very important role to play in the world stage , if it on a common foreign and security policy , the so-called third pillar in the Treaty of Maastricht and the creation of einsatzbereiter militärsicher capacity to ensure peace of the priorities . 
in a world which is global and vernetzter , it is now our policy , international law to establish , especially the United Nations , but also on other worldwide organisations . we therefore have a legal framework for the international relations conceived , because we are convinced that this is the best way possible conflicts to prevent and deal with them . 
we believe that the European Union in order to speak with one voice should , as a trade , economic and social power and a great defender of human rights , the Multikulturalismus and the environment caveat so . 
the reality of our current situation , however , is disappointing . 
once again , the internal divisions on at various summits made grandiose statements by the Heads of State and Government . 
I refer to the different positions which the fifteen countries in the United Nations Security Council to the conflict in Iraq have represented . 
the behaviour of Mr Aznar , the Spanish State , and various others , would be reprehensible alone , so as to describe it , because this division . because instead on the adoption of a common position adopted by the Council of the European Union to wait springing from it quickly and the instructions of spoken , unilateral create a new world order . 
the worst thing is that Mr Aznar and his colleagues an illegal war there have been promoting a humanitarian disaster in the thousands of children , women and civilians , mutilated or were injured and in fear of hunger and disease . 
and the worst thing is that Mr Aznar contravened the constitution , without the approval of the European Parliament or the approval of the King of Spain , and that , together with its Getreuen contrary to the global view and of the opinion of weapons inspectors and without the support of the UN Security Council acted . this is the law and international institutions are a serious blow to the world and the Stärksten extradited , the violence and open the door , sense and justice , second and third pillars . 
in summary , I should like to say that we owe them that the world , once again , the law of the jungle governed and that the third pillar of the European Union to . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by Mr Philippe Morillon , on his excellent report . 
this debate and the fact that it is quite a few amendments , has shown that it has understood , in this very important issue in a very broad consensus in this House . 
if we do with the situation five years in similar debates , we see that there are a very broad consensus on the need for a European Verteidigungsbeitrags in this House . 
for my congratulations to Philippe Morillon . 
his report is an important building block in the development of a Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
why is it necessary ? 
we have in September of last year , the new Sicherheitsstrategie of the United States . 
we are seeing the week after week , such as this Sicherheitsstrategie of the United States systematically is implemented . 
what we as Europeans , there is a need for a European Sicherheitsstrategie answer . 
it is essential that we as Europeans as one of a common foreign policy , first of all our interests jointly . 
I believe that this is possible . 
firstly , there is a broad consensus that we , as the European Union to capable of us in the framework of NATO , together with our allies , if necessary , but also autonomous against any possible Angreifer . 
I would very much welcome it if the convention were to be a mutual Beistandsklausel for the new constitution for the European Union . 
secondly , we should develop the abilities . this means that we need a little time , the geographical context of the European Union necessary contributions to crisis management , and zivil and militarily . 
this is not yet the case , we have not yet autonomous , but it is a capacity that we need to develop . 
thirdly , we should be the European Union to be able to across the world and always Rettungsoperationen , when it comes to the safety of European citizens . 
these are three further building blocks for an Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
if we do , we must take account of the experience which we similar major projects , such as the internal market or in the European currency . 
these were only inadequate , because we clear content and long-term targets , what is the things we should be able to want . 
some answers on this subject in the report by Philippe Morillon . 
what the citizens of the European Union is peace , security and stability . 
as a European Parliament , we must make our contribution that the European Union as a whole this claim indeed . 
Madam President , in connection with Iraq schwankte my mood between anger , Bedrückung and determination . 
I am furiously vote in favour of the arrogance and the Selbstüberschätzung of the United Kingdom and the United States , as the war . 
I am saddened that the European Union in its efforts to prevent this war and a peaceful disarming the Iraqis , so powerless . 
but I am determined to ensure that , if I with my own small way to do that we have a rather united and coherent , uniform , common European security and defence policy . 
I am convinced that a European Union were to be able to prevent this war Saddam Hussein to disarm and also a major contribution to the production of peace between Israelis and Palestinians . 
this is still , and we should do everything in our relatively passing to , which in many cases to national self-interest , and in this way , a common position for Europe . 
we in the world is an important role to play , and we must now try to this role . 
in view of the most serious Sicherheitskrise after the end of the Cold War we have as a Union unable seriously and effectively against this crisis . 
this is very shocking . 
it would be töricht to adopt the war against Iraq would be a one-off plan for war . 
it is obvious that Syria , Iran and also , of course , Cuba and North Korea also on the list . 
the European Union must at last , the situation in the and make it clear that the type of action against Iraq have begun , and that we do not support all serious and peaceful mechanisms for the prevention of conflicts are about to set up in order to achieve what the world needs , namely the stability and peace . 
the today in the forefront of Europe are politicians are only prepared to speak with one voice when it comes to their own . 
the common foreign and security policy is obviously not important enough , to make concessions . 
as long as the foreign policy in the European Union will continue to renationalised , a common defence as a steuerloses Kampfflugzeug pilots , which is , in the air depend . 
both the exaggerated British loyalty towards Washington and the permanent French anti-Americanism are not the right guide for the European politics . 
it is essential to prevent an enlarged Union into a pro- and a antiamerikanisches camp from splintering . 
good transatlantic relations are for Europe , for the United States and the rest of the world of crucial importance . 
if the United States their pax Americana aufoktroyieren are the political leaders of Europe to blame . 
as long as they severely which , as it is right , and Europe as a whole too little in the defence investments are we condemned , a Nebenrolle in the world to play . 
the European Union must at least on our own continent military action , preferably within NATO , but if independently . 
the involvement and strengthen the military resources will be the basis for a common and solid security policy . 
the development of a European strategic concept , where the emphasis placed on the crisis , is a great goal , however , we can only achieve if the leaders of Europe exclusively with one voice . 
otherwise , should they prefer to keep their mouths . 
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as a member of the GUE-NGL-Fraktion , of course , I share many of the concerns of the majority of my group , and in particular , I am of the question : what progress can be achieved in the defence cultures , if they do not have a common foreign policy has been set . 
I should like to say that I have also Präventivkriege such as that in Iraq , in principle reject the differences of opinion and the countries of Europe , in this important issue regret . 

nevertheless , I think and say : if the monopoly of NATO , as you know , a dominated by the United States , not organisation and conflicts through a strong and effective European diplomacy to regulate , then we must build a Europe of defence . 
we need a sort of Europe with clear objectives and principles , with specific tasks , with adequate resources and equipment and a legitimate , democratically controlled decision-making process . 
in my opinion , must conflicts throughout the world diplomatic channels , especially in the context of the UN . 
but in order to have a sufficient diplomatic weight and , therefore , conflicts with diplomatic means to be resolved , is a real ability to carry out military action , and many others , I think that Europe must not abandon . 
in short , if Europe fate into the hands of the United States , it must lay the necessary conditions , and the Europe of defence at long last . 
Madam President , rarely has a report such as the time of General Philippe Morillon , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur : priorities and weaknesses , unfortunately , more weaknesses . 
firstly , this report comes so in good time before the until the end aufgehobenen debate on the common foreign and security policy in the convention , and secondly , it is at a time when in Europe , the more pressing issue is the direction in which a security and Verteidigungsarchitektur should move , within NATO and outside NATO , as a partner of the United States in seeing transatlantic alliance or removed from the European short in its infancy ? 
the common foreign and security policy the European Union and conflict prevention and strengthen international security is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the establishment of a common foreign policy , which is the prerequisite for the development of a European defence policy , even as a matter of course , is in this House , even if it since the war in Kosovo is clear that the European Union in the situation must be peace-keeping and friedensschaffende tasks to carry out what they are already in Macedonia . 
flaws in our attempts are Doppelgleisigkeiten , such as that NATO a rapid intervention force has created a short on European rapid reaction force . 
I therefore believe that it is important that , in a Zusatzantrag , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group will be a permanent task force until 2009 in a Kosovo-ähnlichen conflict in the geographical area of Europe in cooperation with NATO , or even to be autonomous should be . 
this is an open and we are aware , Richtungsstreit within the EU &apos; s first . 
Austria has , since the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam clear that it is solidarity in line with a common European security policy . 
we welcome any step in a for practicable direction , and therefore support the concept of General Morillon . 
Madam President , the serious international crisis usually cast a special light on the national disparities between the EU Member States . 
although the Union in crisis management and successful a central role in the Balkans and in Afghanistan , we were unable to accept promptly and efficiently the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia . 
the Irakkrieg the differences in history , Geopolitik and the political priorities of the Member States , to the fore . 
the internal political situation in the various Member States will be further encouraged the controversy . 
we need any special cynicism , if the objective of the common European security guarantees for a utopian dream . 
however , it is clear that the NATO power and Europe more responsibility for their security and defence policy . 
the anerkennenswerte report by General Morillon is therefore to be a good time . 
perhaps the current weltpolitische crisis and the Bedrohungsszenarien are really encourage us to strengthen the European voice and ability to act . 
we do not suffice , ambitious . 
we must also be determined and practical . 
that is why the European Convention of the Commission &apos; s role in the foreign policy . 
unfortunately , however , things seem to the contrary , and the cooperation between governments adopted . 
once again we are on the contradiction between word and deed . 
in the work of the convention is obviously an increased activity of certain Member States to Skizzierung a common defence policy . 
we can adopted by the realistic that within the Union in this area with varying pace , as with Schengen and of economic and monetary union . 
but it is important to ensure that no closed clubs , not all . 
in addition , it would be good , foreign and security policy objectives of the various Member States . 
the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs , on Papandreou has a relevant proposal . 
I think this is . 
if we , for example , the Geopolitik resulting from the differences know , we will be the potential for cooperation . 
Madam President , &apos; Argos speiste it with the blood the myth - this line from a poem Péguys on Homer critics of the report , I would like to say to Mr Morillon , because the report of General Morillon is not a myth but undoubtedly the most interesting and sorgfältigsten drawn document on this point , which I have for years in the eyes . 

the reasons for this positive assessment in the ambitious objective and in which this proposed realistic way . 

it is already on the adequacy of the report at this stage , been pointed out , in its comprehensive nature of the previous speakers have said . 
personally , I would like to highlight the sense of perspective and the excellent exposition of the need to be taken Zusammenspiels the institutional elements . 
furthermore , I would like the very creative dealing with the concept of closer cooperation , realistic and pragmatic way to the defence cultures , in the context of a genuine Gemeinschaftsverteidigung . 
it is the Bauanleitung for a Europe of defence which , in this report to the present and future realities and in particular to the challenge of terrorism is . 
it is often said that the generals put their armies to previous wars . 
I hope that , in the future , no new war , but , as we know , there are many conflicts . 
a general is proposing that we are in favour of the present and future conflicts scenario . 
for that he deserves thanks . 
I do not know whether this terrible neo-colonial war against Iraq soon to an end , but I am sure that the victory of American generate a war , which the whole of mankind has opposed it does not prevent not throw at all . 
a barrier against war by President Bush would have a common position of Europe , but the European Union was and is divided and therefore powerless and weak . 
a Europe that the approach of the United States of the versagte , was not enough ; it would have a specific opposition from the EU as such to sell . 
never was the lack of a single and united voice as significant as this tragic situation ; never was the absence of the presence of Europe with its own seat so much in the United Nations Security Council . 
Europe can and must , in the world with its own independent foreign and defence policy by weight , only a separate and independent economic , political and military force , which are not unlike the United States , but they are independent . 
and Europe should , above all , his definition and his commitment to peace solemnly reaffirm , with a simple and clear explanation of how we propose an amendment : &apos; Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict from &apos; . 
Madam President , I can tell you that , in this fortunate citizens in a quarter of Baghdad , together with unbewaffneten US-Soldaten a huge Statue of Saddam Hussein from Sockel . 
the British Conservatives have the quest for an independent European security and defence policy are as one of the unbesonnensten political objectives of the European Union . 
others have been to bring the Irrglauben , that the ESDP mainly assume that the European countries to a more comprehensive contribution to defence . 
if this were the case , then it is a laudable objectives . 
in reality , however , is the transatlantic alliance further , there is no additional troops and there is no real purpose , with the exception of a transfer of powers in defence and security of Nato-Hauptquartier - where European countries with our American allies in a negotiating table - to the European Union , in particular marginalisation of the United States . 
as the presidency has today once again , there is the ESDP which European integration . 
the divisions within NATO and elsewhere in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges there were a conscious consequence of this policy . 
the ESDP is not just a threat to NATO , it is an extremely intergovernmental organisation . 
the report by my friend , General Morillon aspect refers specifically to the objective of a communitarisation of defence policy within the European Union . 
I have the reservations of Commissioner Patten . 
the British Conservatives speaking against this report , as the Gebrauchsanweisung for an EU armed force and a substantial increase in the Gemeinschaftsbefugnisse in the defence and security . it is proposed , the European Commission competencies for military operations to grant discharge , including the right of initiative in the area of crisis management . 
the Community budget is the general costs for military operations . it is a common Beschaffungs- and Produktionspolitik based on &apos; of the military needs of the EU as such &apos; , the establishment of a common Militärakademie the EU , a clause for collective defence in the form of the Minutes of the Treaty on European Union , a common EU-Polizeieinheit and a common coastguard and a permanent seat for the EU in the UN Security Council . 
after the British Prime Minister , his experience with the Irakkrieg , I hope now that it recognises , as töricht and harmful to the establishment of defence structures , which is only to a deepening the gulf between the countries of Europe and the United States . 
I also hope that the United States , notwithstanding the wide American / British solidarity in the Irakkrise no longer Tony Blairs use for the ESDP just accepting . 
they should know better and the consolidation of a new centrepiece . 
the European Union attaches more importance to their political ambitions in the interests of the citizens of the Member States . 
Madam President , the Irak-Krise has the extremely important subject of the common foreign , defence and security of the European Union dramatically been brought into focus . 
the report , Mr Morillon , and the previous report Lalumière the concerns and the findings of the European Parliament . 
however , they illustrate the political Korrelationen . 
a positive example is the latest presence of the European Union in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia . 
the problem is . 
observations , observations that proposals , but when decisions are made , it is a lack of their implementation . 
I would like to ask you , as it is with the implementation of the Galileo-Programms ? 
what is the famous Petersberg-Truppe and the Petersberg tasks ? 
what is the Eurofighter ? 
what is the programme for the construction of the major Lufttransporters , despite the fact that the last two programmes not programmes of the European Union ? 
sometimes , I wonder , we have not ultimately water to Danaïden-Fass ? 
Europe is a peacekeeping force , but it is also a power for security and international cooperation . 
Europe must develop its own person and as an equal partner and an ally . 
Europe must its decisions at institutional and practical level . 
the initiative of Germany and the three other countries , in principle . 
we will see . 
often , we have here to the ancient Athens and the old Rome referred ; however , we have recently different vielfarbig gekleidete kings and leaders , from the old colonial Königreichen untergegangenen in goldverzierten car tour the capitals of some European countries paradierten . 
I do not know whether any significant similarity between certain European political leaders in a divided Europe is , in certain intervals at Camp David or the location of the new Rome their Empfehlungsschreiben . 
finally , I would like to propose , Commissioner , Minister , that is not perhaps it would be better if only symbolic reasons , some of the important meeting political will on the location of the European Union , our equality , our potential and our outlook symbolic . 
Madam President , in my opinion , the issues dealt with in this report strategic importance , but also one of the most urgent priorities , which the European Union in the context of a uniform and coherent foreign policy , not only in the fight against terrorism , but also in the defence and security action . 
I therefore support the report Morillon and will support all proposals which these policies to restore the credibility and : the increase in the national defence budgets in the context of this strategy ; a proportion of the EU &apos; s budget for the promotion of research and development ; one on the integration and the cessation of duplicating and waste abzielende ; Ad-hoc-Kooperationen planning and closer cooperation , if some Member States from legitimate reasons not to participate in this commitment , transparent and effective integration of the European defence a renewed NATO , or in a Atlantisches alliance , the sanctity of reiterates once again . 
the next serious Irak-Krise must also those who do not have these objectives , their Vogelstraußpolitik give up . 
it is a concrete and visionary itinerary as for the monetary union . 
the convention , Madam President , on the opinion of the majority of Europeans , together with Parliament on the return of effective Multilateralität and a handlungsfähigen Union . 
Madam President , after the report by General Morillon there is a desire , the European Union to militarisieren , and this is also of the advocates of peace . 
as the report in accordance with the constitution of the EU is ready , it was possible measures , which we know that they are already being implemented . 
in the Treaty should be included a separate Solidaritätsklausel , whereby Member States are obliged , including terrorist threats . 
the principle of the Präventivkriegs in the EU . 
the military vanguard of the EU Member States will have the opportunity to an even weitergehendere cooperation to manage the crisis : if the EU in the work of the Kampftruppen widened , it is an illegal act without any UN mandate and with contempt for the geographical borders . 
the most military countries can guarantee of security in a different form of a statement or a protocol in terms of Article 5 of the EC Treaty . 
well , is that the Kriegsfragen power in the Council must decide unanimously . 
that is better than it was in the Commission to decide whether or not an attack is carried out . 
I ask you to remember that , in the EU countries are not members of the Militärbündnis . 
Madam President , the report by Mr Morillon , the told us that Europe is a uniform line and to strengthen his military capability , if it is to be a credible player , this spannungs- and so this is precisely the right time . 
the war in Iraq is such a dramatic event , we must not be surprised if it serious differences of opinion between the Member States ; however , my impression after the first signs of a Meinungsumschwungs obvious and is already a great temptation , on the Siegerseite - the United States , too , as soon as the battle is over . 
the countries against war , I have already stated , some Brosamen abzubekommen and to the kind . 
however , as General Morillon - a French General , but also a major supporters of Europe - has said , we cannot , in the decision-making process if we do not share the burden supports . 
I hope that it has quickly at the end of the political Wahnvorstellungen that I have just heard in this House and the United States in Iraq to Syria , Cuba and what I know what countries are still people . 
the differences between the Member States were not specify in the European public , the large majority voting against the American action was . 
fortunately , there was in Europe Heads of State and Government , which have been able to the public misstrauen and our own idea of the world peace : peace in this case , unfortunately , only be made by a war , was necessary to make a greater tragedies in the coming years . 
if the Union &apos; s own Verteidigungsfähigkeit - as in the report of Mr Morillon , and its own foreign affairs , she is a significant role in the world , and I hope that they will be the right decisions . 
Madam President , two thousand years has said that the Römer Cicero that there are two ways of resolving differences exist - negotiation or violence . 
as for the people is intended for wild animals . 
Ciceros words are still in force . 
we want to solve conflicts as people negotiations or wild animals by violence ? 
the EU in active prevention or more resources for the human being to develop before birth conflicts , i.e. additional funds to invest in the military area ? 
the conflicts of today and tomorrow are really to be resolved by ? 
I do not think so . 
what can we from the currently taking place in Iraq war and from the fragmentation of the EU in matters of common foreign and security policy learn ? 
I believe the European Union &apos; s international activities , the United Nations and its capacity for conflict prevention and -lösung , instead of more energy and resources in a common military defence to invest in the final analysis , however , as Commissioner Patten said , national issues . 
the EU should make sure that the reconstruction of Iraq under the auspices of the UN . 
the warring parties is not an even-handed and cannot , therefore , the responsibility for the reconstruction . 
my own country , Sweden , strongly for conflict prevention , peace and crisis management . 
neither Sweden still I support a common defence or joint financing . 
similarly , we support the idea that certain countries in the common Verteidigungsarbeit could take the lead , or the introduction of a clause to the collective defence . 
the war is a matter , in the hands of the military to , even in the my colleague Mr General Morillon . 
the most important tasks are the defence of international law , the strengthening of the UN and its work and comprehensive capacity in the Union to Erkennung , prevention and resolution of conflicts . 
this is where the European Union is a major contribution to peace . 
Cicero have already been above 2 000 years that only wild animals conflicts through violence to try to resolve . 
it is high time that the EU should have focused on conflicts , instead of going . 
Madam President , I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Morillon , on his report , it is precisely the right time , for two reasons : first , the common defence policy is a subject which , in the European Union will be discussed and , secondly , the urgently by other Members have already said . 
the present time , the Irakkrise a problem that affects us all . 
although the problem of a common , within the European Union have different solutions , when the Union is neither a common foreign policy on a common defence policy . 
perhaps we should remember that , in the introduced the founding of the European defence community . 
but the attempt key brake . this report is a positive step , as well as the some years ago by the President &apos;s report . 
it is a long process in which we are working in Europe , in order to create a common defence policy , which is against anyone , but on the cooperation with our allies and also with the Alliance , on the other side of the Atlantic . 
this is not a against NATO policy ; a policy of cooperation with NATO . 
just as we in the year 2002 have managed to establish a single currency , which has not yet each country is involved , however , it will change in the foreseeable future , we must create a common security and defence policy , and in the knowledge that the money is going to cost , but also in the belief that the European Union has the necessary financial resources . 
the convention must take into account when drafting of the Unionsvertrages . 
Madam President , since the collapse of the real socialism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union , a when the distribution of new markets and the wealth of the former Socialist countries and the redistribution of the had already vergebenen markets . 
it is a angespannter competition between the Member States of the European Union and with the United States . 
at the same time , the European Union a comprehensive attack on the achievements of workers . 
in order to achieve these objectives , the European defence and security policy , with the report , Mr Morillon . 
obviously , there are actually finding excuses , conflict prevention , crisis management , etc . the truth is that a European army is created , with Söldnern by modern training trained and equipped with modern weapons whose task is to the interests of big business , wherever it has always NATO and the orders to intervene , to defend themselves . 
of course , it is , as the report Morillon state , this is not about the relationship between the European Union and NATO and the United States is considering breaking off . 
on the contrary , there is talk of mutual strengthen and close cooperation with NATO , which is seen as a stroke bonds , the United States and the interests of Europe . 
it also means that it is inevitable , because , among other things , the majority of Member States of the European Union , the majority of Member States of the NATO , yet dominated by the United States and . 
these ties alone would , in the true nature and the role of the famous ESDP to make this clear . 
the people , as we can be sure , will no doubt . 
they have had bitter experiences with NATO and the policy of the European Union in security and defence issues have witnessed . 
the Proklamationen after 11 September , &apos; we are all Americans &apos; , receive in their ears . 
the people saw recently , such as the Member States of the European Union in Prague the new aggressive NATO policy , the Präventivschläge , signed . this is exactly what the American and British imperialists currently in Iraq do and what it if the people permit elsewhere , also be doing . 
you know , moreover , that the proposals which armament by increasing military , although the European defence industry a profitable future to ensure that it has , however , for their safety , the income of people and for the peace process does not bode well . 
it is a disgrace that these proposals by the Greek Government have been tabled and which , without shame , proud , is that the war before the end of the Greek Presidency will be completed . 
this is not a defence and security policy , it is a policy of aggression insecurity . and this is why this policy is contrary to the vision of our people , the it . 
the crime in Iraq , which are currently being committed , since we are talking about here , there is , after Yugoslavia and Afghanistan , once again , an idea of the objectives of these policies . 
the people are calling for an diametrically opposed policy , a policy of peace , peaceful coexistence of peoples , a policy of resolving the conflict , without violence and war to a policy of disarmament and peace . 
I am sure they will this policy , as well as their enemy stemmen against it . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the last Wortbeitrag and even some before that I am always doubt aware , for example , where a Kommunist so exactly what the people want ? 
others have said here , it is about the distribution of wealth socialism . 
I hope that our citizens would more these debates . 
a Social Democrat the &apos; colonial centre Camp David &apos; . 
I wonder what we arguments in this debate , and I wonder whether it before the citizens of their country , to say . 
if you take , for example , the Kosovo . 
in Kosovo to the citizens that the European Union ? . 
? . 
Mr Korakas , the European citizens , that in the twenty-first century , on the continent of Europe do not Massenvergewaltigungen and expulsions . 
that is why the European security and defence policy . 
we have seen in 1999 , as Europeans we would be in no position to act , if the Americans would not help us . 
this was the Helsinki Summit in 1999 . we are progress with what we have developed in the institutions . 
the report Morillon expressed in an exemplary manner . on 1 April , we have a small mandate for the first time in Macedonia , also to the pacification in a situation in a country , and not military conflicts , such as the some raised here . 
I think that are good signals from Europe , the citizens expect us . 
the time of our debate on this report is a very important . now it is important that both the two extreme parties , German and British Government - back in European institutions and that they are once again trying to European solutions to find a way to make . 
we have all seen in this armed conflict : in the world , we are all nothing . we cannot have a contribution to peace in the world , when we act against . 
we need European mechanisms . 
in this report suggests , is a richtigerer step than the summit will shortly be discussed in Brussels . as meet only four Member States , but at the suspicion that there are more about a against other allies affecting political action . 
we also need Britain with , because without the United Kingdom is this not succeed . 
Madam President , I should first like to congratulate Mr Morillon , on his report , in a balanced way , vision and imagination realism and pragmatism . 
I would also wish to him that even Mr Korakas him again , then it is a different opinion . 
the real question we face is , of course , provocative said that the European Union is a Militärmacht ? 
I agree with the previous speaker , Mr Laschet right : we have in recent weeks and months weltpolitisch role as Europe is not , unfortunately . 
this is the fact . 
it is now in particular , of course , as Commissioner Patten will always says . 
we are actually willing , a role to play ? 
I believe - and the report of Mr Morillon , with a large majority , shows that , in this House we wish to a sensible weltpolitische role to play . 
we can military substantiating ? 
I believe that a military substantiating can help us if there is a common foreign and security policy . 
the common foreign and security policy , but not replace can help and support them very well . 
now , I am sceptical about the arms race . 
it would be drunk in fact , before we have wettgerüstet , because it was a opponents , with which we have a strong . we must now arms race , because there is a partners , namely the United States of America , with which we must gleichrüsten . 
but - and this is right to read the report says - Mr Morillon , primarily , not solely , but primarily , it is a question of our defence expenditure to coordinate and coordinate so that we firstly with the same amount of a much greater effect , greater efficiency . 
secondly , there is no doubt to see where are the gaps as Europeans we can finish . 
in fact , there are two alternative models : that it is , as there is no alternative . 
the alternative is that we as the United States a Militärmacht , just a little less and less imperialistisch , a little less effective . 
this is not acceptable . 
the other alternative is that we are working for a common foreign and security policy a military justification , as they Morillon expressed in his report , so that we efficiently and are in a multilateral policy to act . 
this , we are not at present . 
the report by Mr Morillon , on how we operate efficiently in a multilateral framework . 
we therefore support the report clearly Morillon . 
Madam President , General Morillon has an interesting and sound report which , in some parts of the convention will certainly influence . 
the European defence industry is key to the development of a common European defence policy , which form part of the transatlantic cooperation . 
we must have a strong European defence industry , and is based on competition , and . 
we should try to abolish any trade protectionism , also in the field of the arms trade , and the United States of completely opening up of their Waffenmarktes . 
the current system ineffective is expensive and . 
the taxpayers have the right to demand that each and every euro efficient use of us think European . 
a European Rüstungsagentur is therefore absolutely necessary . 
the European taxpayer really believe that it out rationally and efficiently , the development of three ultramodernen Kampfflugzeugen ? 
the European defence industry COs run the risk of sites to the Hochtechnologieforschung pure Montageanlagen . 
this would make Europe less and dependent . 
however , I cannot under any circumstances , we believe that more without the United Kingdom . 
we should look at the constructive part and on common definitions and methods . 
only with greater budgets for supplying arms and a to research that European defence industry within the framework of a common defence policy can be a credible , effective and reliable partner of the United States . 
Madam President , I would like to thank my honourable friend General Morillon on his report . 
as previous speakers have already said , it is the right time . 
I am a strong supporter of the creation of a EU-Verteidigungspolitik , because I believe that this is a fundamental part of the European integration as the single currency . 
if , in addition , we learn from the debacle and want to draw the confusion in which the European Union is at the moment , then the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference at the heart of this report arguments . 
I am a clear supporter of the Transatlantic Alliance between the EU and the United States , but not in its present form , if only expected of us , the foreign policy objectives of the United States rubber-stamp , even if we do not agree with them . 
we need a new balance on the basis of a real partnership will be created , in which the two sides of the work of the policies agreed objectives . 
however , we must understand that we have any influence on the United States , if we are in such a dependence on them . 
as General Morillon said , we must also share the burden . 
furthermore , that a EU-Verteidigungspolitik on a single common foreign and security policy are based . 
I am not believe that our current differences of opinion in our divided response to the crisis in Iraq to pessimism and Lähmungserscheinungen should be . 
if anything , then this political demand , to ensure that in future never happen again . 
if we use our influence on the world stage really want to make , then the EU-Staats- and Government to agree to the offices of the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations zusammenzulegen , a single management with adequate financial services and all our instruments in strategic sector - including trade , development , environment , Justice and Home Affairs , on the use , in order to clear political objectives in the heart of our foreign policy . 
we hope that we in this way , the creation of defence structures , not the importance of conflict prevention and continuous investment in our Demokratisierungs- and human rights strategy ignore , because violations in these areas , in many parts of the world of conflict . 
Madam President , I would also like to support the excellent report by Mr Morillon , in a great way and integrate Atlantiker Euro-Gaullisten . 
as someone who is much euro-gaullistischer than Mr Morillon , I would like to konzedieren that it is excellent , these two elements of European foreign and security policy to combine . 
we can the European defence question so as not to discuss the question of whether we need a European Marmeladen-Richtlinie or not . 
it is merely the raison d &apos;être of the gathering of European unification . 
this is not only do so , I can see that many of our citizens . this is shown by the surveys undertaken . 
the meaning of European unification is peace and security , peace and security , both internally and externally . 
that is why it is high time that we make progress in the common foreign and security policy , and I am not as pessimistic as many other Members . 
it is true that our governments have a jämmerliches picture . 
but if you public opinion of the people , so there is between peoples in the major effect , including the Irak-Krieg - a much greater agreement and between governments . 
I believe that we need instruments and institutions , the common will of the people , not only &apos; , but also an active and honour , because it is not only the atmosphere behind . 
we need a good , long-term strategy as the basis of a common foreign and security policy . 
I believe that the convention is the last opportunity , in the major Community of 15 - and soon the 25 or 30 - of a common foreign and security policy . 
I hope that this . 
I do not Kern-Europa . 
I do not want to fragmentation of Europe . 
but if it in this wider circle fails to make progress , then it is a development towards a Kern-Europa . 
however , to a Kern-Europa , which is open to all those who are prepared to a common foreign and security policy . 
I would like to a more say quite clearly : I believe that we need the Atlantic Alliance . 
but even Franz-Josef Strauß , the late chairman of my party , said : &apos; the Atlantic Alliance will only have a future , if it permanently on two equally powerful pillars based on an American pillar and on a European pillar . &apos; 
and that this European pillar does not exist , is not the fault of the Americans . 
it is our responsibility as Europeans . 
we will be after enlargement , which we have adopted today , more people than Russia and the United States , and that is why it is high time that we for our foreign and security policy do more , the structures . 
in the context of a aggressive structure , but in the context of an active Friedenswahrung , as they are now it is in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges have not been able , but the real task of the European Union , since the founding of there . 
Madam President , the Moderaten Sammlungspartei needs of the need for a common foreign and security policy . 
if the EU must exercise influence , its Member States . 
this is the joint policy , especially for small countries in the EU of particular importance . 
unfortunately , the common foreign and security policy in the last few months Scherben . 
however , we hope that we are now that the people in the centre of Bagdads on the case of Saddam jubeln and try to be vast Standbild umzustürzen , the European Union in the creation of a common policy . 
a few hours , most of us to a comprehensive enlargement of the European Union . 
this was probably the most important political decision which the majority of us ever . 
many of the new Member States have to tackle their security question then membership of a high priority . 
after the days of the Cold War , the NATO to a pan-European Sicherheitsorganisation . 
this we must , in the development of common security policy the European Union not ignore . 
the common security policy of the EU must not , in contrast to the NATO . 
the cooperation must be further deepened . 
I also hope that my own country , the same solution for its security policy , however , such as the Baltic neighbours , i.e. membership of NATO . 
I see the aim of the European security policy is not primarily to build a strong common Militärmacht .
