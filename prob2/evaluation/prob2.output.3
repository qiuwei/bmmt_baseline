the former fight of all the MEP from Greece and many of their comrades-in-arms has ultimately led to success . 
our the honourable Member and rapporteur , Mr Poos , has a significant contribution . 
in my opinion , it is encouraging that , ultimately , this has been taken , the unpraktikablen amerikanisch-britischen plan . 
now , it is the free Republic of Cyprus as a member of the European Union the opportunity , with the Besatzermacht , Turkey and its local representative , Mr Denktash , a fair political solution to the Zypern-Frage , broker a solution to the the overwhelming majority of the Turkish Cypriots , together with the Greek Cypriots sehnlichst hopes . 

the Republic of Cyprus is a completely confused legal situation , as the north of the island illegally occupied by Turkey . 
this occupation is in the rest of the United Nations , as well as the European Union . 

I am still of the opinion that it was necessary to vote for the accession , because the Cypriots by means of a &apos; no &apos; vote twice punished would be : they are already of the Turks occupied and would then be rejected by the Union . 
in fact , a definitive conclusion on Turkey must be spoken , because it is the only thing they . 
it would be to clearly understand that it must be the status of a assoziierter partner of the European Union if they do not lose , from the north of the island . 
I regret that we in the past was not the courage to do this , but I hope that this will happen in the future . 


but unfortunately , this is not the way in which the Union , because it is indeed a Schmusekurs still sails by the accession of Turkey still maintaining financial aid to double , and this also einstuft Beitrittsvorbereitung as yet . 
under these circumstances , we are calling for , I would stress that , the opening of the possible accession negotiations with Turkey referenda in every country in Europe will be carried out . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen . 
the Council has , in spite of the warnings and the Commission &apos; s Vorhaltungen during the negotiations - insisted on a clear Rechtsbruch . 
with the controversial maintenance of Annex XV in the accession treaty and the totally unilateral change to the financial framework of the Council has 2004-2006 the interinstitutional agreement ( IIV ) between Parliament and the Council of 6 May 1999 broken . 
that is the Budgetrechte of Parliament are being trampled underfoot . 
at the same time , requires it to alternative either for his rights or to vote in favour of the Accession Treaties . 
with such a way , the Council has been disrupted acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries must make this point of view of the ELDR Group , their preparations in each country have completed and must be examined individually . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen , according to which the border of Cyprus , which will soon be a external borders of the European Union and , therefore , the Netherlands , will be sufficiently is safe . 
in addition , we trust that the EU to find a solution to the Cyprus conflict . 
if we are in the vote on the accession of Cyprus have included , not because we have to be ashamed of taking the Cypriot people . 
no , we , the leaders of the European Union Unverantwortlichkeit . 
if we than a divided country whose existenzielles issue is resolved , in the European Union , although with regret , then this is an ( further ) evidence that the inability of the Union as such , genuine political will to demonstrate . 
the accession of Cyprus in the Union , of course , would have to be dependent on its reunification . 
however , rather than this condition and the question of the accession of Cyprus , as a lever to use the European Union , to regret the fact that they themselves a divided country . 
we think dare to dream great dreams ! 

this umpteenth wasted opportunity will not have that a of a foreign power besetztes country in the Union will be admitted that Turkey an additional and permanent means of blackmail with regard to the European Union in the will and the external borders of the Union de facto to the green line will set a limit - which neither the European Union or otherwise irgendjemandem apart from Turkey to be recognised . 


Mr President , this chapter 5 years was the our guiding principle of the Union : deepening before enlargement . 
the Heads of State and Government repeated in learned way that the structures and the decision-making process of the Union of enlargement on 25 and more Members must be reformed . 
this should be done with the Treaty of Nice . 
but nothing has been dealt with this Treaty , but the decision-making process in the Council more complicated . 
therefore , showed the need for the convening of a European convention , to a new Gründungsvertrag , to a European constitution . 
with the signing ceremony of the accession treaties on 16 April 2003 is enlargement before the end of the work of the convention . 
it is a enlargement in institutional confusion , especially since the Irakkrise the süßen ideals , in the context of a common foreign and security policy has had been made . 
Mr President , I voted for the inclusion of the Republic of Latvia in the European Union votes . 
as a single representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party Italy in this House , I hope and wish that the Letten in the next European Parliament , which also about the Republic of Latvia extended , including a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party , which may choose together with the other - as I very much hope many , Representative of the Rentnerparteien for the first time in 2004 , all the countries in the European Parliament will be able to help the interests of the elderly citizens to defend themselves . 
. 
I have the accession Treaties in protest and only in solidarity with my future ladies and gentlemen .

with such a way , the Council has been disrupted acknowledging the loyal cooperation . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries must make this point of view of the ELDR Group , their preparations in each country have completed and must be examined individually . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria , no doubt that the from the European Parliament on many occasions . 
on 8 April , I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen that even the countries in which he even the most deficits , including Latvia , at the time of their accession will be sufficient to meet the Copenhagen criteria . 
the warnings of Commissioner Verheugen to some candidate countries , the decision of the Commission , six months before the accession of a Comprehensive to publish Report monitoring by the ELDR Group proposed peer group review of the new and old Member States in the field of human rights , corruption , Verwaltungskapazität and independent financial control ( Amendment No Malmström / Maaten ) , the for the Commission , the possibility of a few years direct measures against the internal market , to take ( the Garantieklauseln ) , and the own-initiative report , Mr Mulder , on the reform of the approval of the expenditure are therefore of crucial importance . 
Mr President , this chapter 6 I am not one of the Poland and other countries , that they want to abstrafen in favour of the Atlantic solidarity preferred of European solidarity . 
every state , each government has the right to support the Kriegspolitik Bush or not . 
but it is clear that the majority of the new members of the Union an American Alliance and the NATO a broader European integration . 
the representatives of the British government in the convention their delight over this development . 
in an interview with The Times was Peter Hain , make it clear that it is an alliance with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe against any shift towards a European superstate . 
the United Kingdom and others will therefore not hesitate to the Intergovernmental Conference , what the results of the convention to confirm to make use of their right of veto . 
this veto could , in any intention to qualified majority decision-making in areas such as the common foreign and security policy , the budgetary and fiscal policy , the economic and social policy . 
the use of the word &apos; federal &apos; will be verfehmt . 
an appeal to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in judicial decisions for individuals will not be possible . 
Mr President , today , on 9 April 2003 , I voted for the inclusion in Lithuania voted in favour of the European Union . 
I also hope to the inclusion of a representative of the Lithuanian Pensioners &apos; Party in the European Parliament to support in the defence of the rights of all the elderly throughout Europe .

Mr President , I shall now turn to my last chapter . 
in view of the institutional Nebels that I have just , have denounced the enlarged European Union will be forced to confine myself to a single market . 
it is therefore a Freihandelsassoziation , as far as possible , in fact still on the other side of the Atlantic . 
it is interesting that the most supporter of this rash enlargement from the ranks of the former EFTA-Mitglieder . 
since I do not want the enlarged European Union , on a Washington abgesegneten major market in the rich countries , remains for me , as is nothing more than before reluctantly consenting to decide me when it comes to the vote on the accession of all the new Member States to abstain , however , however , I warmly welcome to him . 

Mr President , I voted for Hungary &apos; s accession to the European Union . 
since , in the enlarged Europe at least 200 million pensioners will live , I hope that the withdrawal of Hungary with their own representatives in the European Parliament , it will allow us to make a proper balance between the number of Members and the number of pensioners in Europe . 
I therefore hope that the Hungarian pensioners in this Parliament to send a representative , so that the interests of the elderly throughout Europe more effectively and with more force may be defended .

. 
I voted today against the request of the Republic of Malta for inclusion in the European Union . 
reason for my decision is the detention of Malta to the Zugvogeljagd . 
Malta had in the accession negotiations strictly refused , the during the European Union ( EU-Vogelschutzrichtline ) in full , and has a transitional period , that the Malta has been set up until the end of Vogeljagd 2008 . 
this regulation is a blank cheque for Wilderer and illegal those who sell them . 
hunt High Sea , Singvogeljagd with Schlagnetzen and the mass Abschuss seltenster Singvögel are , after European Rechtsvorstellungen strictly prohibited . 
a Beitrittsbewerber must recognise this legal basis . 
Mr President . 
it was a difficult decision , against the accession of a country to vote in favour of a particularly , on which I . I have a great deal of respect for these serious Gewissensentscheidung for me alone . 
I have tried to influence neither my group , I have influence of it . 
I can add my voice is not a candidate country , the actively with kämpfenden troops in a illegal unmoralischen and dirty war in Iraq , by making Völkerrechtsbruch without any hesitation , and the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians supports . 
Poland is on the wrong way and his government , but not only . 
the Polish people have preferred to see the American Kriegsminister instead of the Polish Pope . 
the Poland are greater in their Spezialeinheit GROM than on their Catholic Bischöfe for peace . 
they conclude by themselves from the community of values in the EU . 
I hope that it will soon be back . 
today , after careful thought , and in complete agreement with my conscience , I have voted &apos; no &apos; . 
Mr President , I hope that the accession also from Poland - I voted for - a representative or a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the next European Parliament and , in this House to me , so that I more force for our common defence policy will be all the elderly throughout Europe . 
there are two reasons for my symbolic vote against the accession of Poland . 
the first reason is that in the so-called &apos; ethical declaration &apos; , which has been added to the accession Treaties and the stand against abortion business and the situation . 
the second reason is the involvement of Polish soldiers on Irak-Krieg , in a demonstration servilen Pro-Amerikanismus and a very vermessenen anti-European position . 
I think that I , for the hopes and wishes of the proud Polish people , that as an independent country and a member of the European Union to conclude a period in which this great , historic country has been used as a satellite , for the time of the United States and before from Russia and Germany . 
we support the right of Poland , as well as all the other candidate countries to join the European Union . 
but this country , make it clear conditions imposed , as are the accession treaty . 
Poland has , for example , is not entitled to the same agricultural subsidies as the countries of the current European Union , although the farmers a large part of its population . 
but the European institutions to subsidise their capitalist agriculture , so that they are profits abwirft , as the poor farmers to help of the countries of their work to be able to live . 
furthermore , the Polish workers , despite all the legal Kopfstände seven years to wait before they come and work in the Union . 
it is also unacceptable that the Union , which is demanding that , if the working classes of this country should be sacrifices , the Polish Church readily concessions . 
the European Union , not only accepted the freedom of women beeinträchtigende Abtreibungsverbot , but also in all , that the relevant Polish legislation can be changed by Community law , and can be so that the Polish women in the cold , under the thumb of a particularly reactionary Church !

. 
I will justify my &apos; no &apos; to the accession of the Republic of Poland , at the moment , to the European Union , so that Poland was the only one candidate country actively with Elitesoldaten in a völkerrechtswidrigen war , which is currently in Iraq . 
- ( NL ) with regard to the accession of today &apos; s ten candidate countries must make this point of view of the ELDR Group , their preparations in each country have completed and must be examined individually . 
on the question of whether all countries will be able to meet the criteria , no doubt that the from the European Parliament on many occasions .

Mr President , bearing in mind that , in Slovenia already - DeSUS on behalf of the Pensioners &apos; Party , on the Government of the country is involved , I hope that your wish . I hope that it is a own representatives in this Parliament can afford to send so that the pensioners not only Slovenia , but all the countries of the new , from the EP-Wahlen produced in 2004 Europe on a massive presence of supporters of the interests of older people can support from the Rentnerparteien all of these countries , including Slovenia , come .

- ( NL ) As a member of the delegation for relations with the Slovakia , I know about the problems of this country about more than on the other candidate countries . 
I note that unsustainable political parties and that the economy , with the result has collapsed a massive unemployment in the East and that the successive governments are not prepared to the families of national minorities or wrong angetanes earlier . 
the re-division in provinces completely , the fact that on the southern edge of Slovakia ungarisch discussed and the vast majority of the local population that ungarisch administration and education . 
the majority of members of the Roma-Bevölkerungsgruppe occupied villages which are still in the East , a Slovak elite a managed to Alleinanspruch Straßenbeleuchtungen , to have Wasserwerke and gardens . 
many people may in Slovakia for , in the neighbouring Vienna work . 
with the accession of Slovakia , the EU imported the environmental problems of the nuclear power stations and of the Donau-Staudamms . 
the accession is , however , in the internally divided Slovakia far less controversial than in the neighbouring countries Poland and the Czech Republic , in which the majority will soon be included in the context of a referendum may will vote against it . 
various groups who would like to see this accession improvements . 
on 5 September 2001 , I fear , that they will be disappointed , but I respect your decision . 

once again is the vote on the calendar of part-sessions of the European Parliament in 2004 , used by the Straßburg-Gegnern in order to reduce Anwesenheitszeit in this city . 
and as the last time this vote , contrary to the Treaty , because of the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions is that held 12 sittings in Strasbourg . 
on 11 meetings is a reduction in traditionellerweise Wahljahren acceptable . 
but this time , the anti-Strasbourg actually went even further , they will only 10 meetings . 
this result is as a absurd machinations of the Party of European Socialists , due to remove the last April , so that we do not need to work on 1 May . 
there is still blatant , that the when we see the weakness of the calendar of part-sessions for 2004 the implementation of 5 Minitagungen in Brussels , which can be accepted only in theory , if the 12 normal plenary part-session in Strasbourg . 
we call on the French Government , the Court of Justice oppose this illegal vote , because the European Parliament is not a sovereign representatives of the people , but has only on the him with the Treaty and has special powers of the Treaty . 


in view of the special importance of 1 May as Internationaler day of the workers for us it is not in question , in this day in the European Parliament to appear . 
the rest of the timetable , affects us and we have no special position on this . 
in accordance with their political line , and the UEN Group is opposed this year each manoeuvres , with the the long run , or the number of the plenary part-session in Strasbourg should be reduced . 
in the last few years various lobby groups always tried , through a variety of activities of the final transfer of the headquarters of the Parliament in Strasbourg to Brussels - I am thinking particularly of the reduction in the plenary part-session to four days or the increase in the extraordinary meetings in Brussels - penetrates into the UEN Group , on compliance with the Treaties , to the letter and spirit in which the implementation of 12 meetings per year in Strasbourg . 


it is customary in Wahljahren a meeting in Strasbourg on Fridays , but , at the same time it must be astonished to note that the number of extraordinary meetings remains unchanged . 
this situation is completely anormal for 2004 , which is why I have proposed , two additional meetings , in order to remove the zwölfte in accordance with the legislation once again Strasbourg part-session . 
it is obvious that so that everyone its responsibility . 
for us things are clear : for Strasbourg must not to the rank of a simple Außenstelle from Brussels herabgestuft ; it is and must the headquarters of the European Parliament . 
with its vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2004 , our House only 10 part-sessions in Strasbourg . 
in the Treaties and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is , however , make it clear that the calendar of part-sessions of the European Parliament annual twelve or in Wahljahren eleven plenary part-session in Strasbourg , before must have the inclusion of additional Minisitzungen in Brussels can be considered . 

therefore , is missing in the for the election year 2004 adopted by the calendar of part-sessions a Strasbourg part-session , not to mention the absurdity of the vote on the day that the European Parliament , the accession Treaties of the new Member States , the Strasbourg part-session , on the original deletion of the Members of the Member States should be welcomed . 
in view of the fact that the result of the European Parliament is illegal , the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group President Pat Cox urgently , to the relevant conclusions and the vote altogether . 
it calls for the urgent convening of the Conference of Presidents , in order to a new as quickly as possible , with the law konforme vote to be added . 
. ( DA ) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report , because we believe that it is necessary to guarantee a fair treatment of third-country nationals , who are legally resident in the country . 
however , we are in principle the opinion that these rights are the best way of the national legislation of the Member States to be regulated , although they are from , but a democratic legitimacy . 
we are also aware that the proposal for a field is concerned , the Title IV of the Treaty Establishing and does not apply to Denmark , cf. the protocol on the position of Denmark . 

in spite of the votes against the MPF-Abgeordneten and also of a large section of the rights of the European Parliament has just the report Cerdeira Morterero , adopted by the Commission &apos; s proposed directive on family reunification and many erweiternde proposes changes . 
with these amendments , in particular , the definition of family members , the make use of family reunification , to the possibility of this right from the applicant speeded up and the Ablehnungsmöglichkeiten for the Member States . 
from our point of view , the Commission &apos; s original proposal was already very bad , both his principle and in his procedures . 
the vote should opening the eyes of the Council . 
even if it does not , is committed to the amendments of the European Parliament to be taken into account ( because this will in this issue simply being consulted ) , the Council should be clear that the principle of a system of family reunification at European level , it is a dangerous mechanism in place . 
it is obvious that the Commission and its allies in future with their common thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism and its lack of wirklichem sense of the European interests constantly to the constant enlargement for this so-called law . 
we are , of course , against the Polygamie and the repression of the for women . 
we accept , however , that under the pretext that one of the wives already living in the host , the other entry and residence be denied . 
under the pretext of moral principles is merely another obstacle to the immigration and personal links . 
although we reject such a limit in principle , we have voted for the amendment , the exemptions at least in the case , if the Kindeswohl this requires . 

furthermore , the amendments we have with demütigendem nature , such as the use of DNA-Tests against the immigrants or the argument of public health , which is based on the selfish attitude , health care , the European countries to refuse people can provide , the otherwise access to them . 
once again , the proposals , the clear progress , not binding , and the report as a whole , will not help each other , the national legislation upwards , but downwards . 
. ( DA ) We have decided to our group , and for the motion for a resolution in the report to vote in favour of Morterero . 
we are but we are aware that the resolution circumstances , the Title IV of the EC Treaty and not , therefore , the whole , apply to Denmark the protocol on the position of Denmark . 
. ( PT ) We are all aware of the gulf between the Tampere Summit statements and the content of this proposal for a directive , aware of the us now , after more than three-year advice in the Council and two amendments to the original proposal of the Commission . 
it was stated that a policy of integration should be aimed at granting rights and duties of immigrants , with those of the citizens of Europe . 
this text is in the opposite direction . 
as a result of differences of opinion in the Council is in line with this proposal Community standards , the &apos; bottom-up &apos; to the lowest common denominator complied with , and , with a reduzierenden exposition of the concept of &apos; members &apos; , and a great many derogations , so that a number of key points will not . 
that is why we support the proposals in this report , the concept of &apos; members &apos; wishes , the principle of non-discrimination and the lifting günstigerer legislation . 
on our initiative , the report now provisions , the examination of applications , not the authorities in addition to its normal workload on and the subjective concept of a long-term relationship . 
it should be banned the incidence of diseases and disabilities according to the issue of the residential status as a justification for the denial of an extension of the residential status . 
with the introduction of these amendments increase quality of the report by the original proposal and therefore deserves our support . 
I would like to my colleague , as I have a member of the intergroup &apos; anti-racism &apos; is , for her work on the important and difficult issue of family reunification . 
I voted in favour of this report and I support it in the light of my previous work in the field of immigration , in which I am , in particular , with secondary migration issues . these include , amongst other things , the provisions in the United Kingdom Ehepaare of different nationalities , which must prove that the main purpose of the Eheschließung not immigration . 
it is important that the Member States of the entry of close relatives as parents and Ehe- or Lebenspartnern , if this is not for their own needs to be able to make . 
the implementation of the directive must not lead to the level of granted by the various Member States . 
. 
( PT ) The immigration is a serious problem , the a realistic and responsible reaction from the Community institutions . 
if no appropriate and balanced measures be taken in this area , then it is precisely the harmful effects , which all European citizens . 
the least during these serious and now widely recognised problems must be done , it is not to further deteriorate . 
as Commissioner António Vitorino said , should clearly be noted that the absorption capacity of the European cities borders . 
we can certainly not the problem of immigration , that is the right to family reunification . 
I think that is quite clear , because I do not deny the importance of this approach . 
but we can and must have the right to family reunification only serious , without its raison d &apos; être . 
in the report and in the resolution on this directive has been a different approach in which this right irrationally subsidised on personal circumstances that has been extended no family relations . 
this linksgerichtete irresponsibility of serves only to the resistance against distrust and a natural fundamental right . 
for all these reasons , I am obliged , to vote against the report . 
that concludes voting time . our 
( the sitting was suspended at 14.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. ) 
the next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0111 / 2003 ) by Mr Morillon , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur - priorities and weaknesses . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as we six months ago in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , our Parliament with the work on this report have begun , that we do not ahnten in such a tragic and distressing time would be submitted . 
the aim was the updating of the previous report by our colleague Mrs Catherine Lalumière , the necessary , because the events of September 2001 should be taken into account and a contribution to the work of our fellow Members of the convention wanted to make . 
a as well as though European security and Verteidigungsstruktur at a time to assess fear because , after all , it is at least temporarily completely to breach the system , as it may seem . 
my fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , as they were disagree on 25 March this year , in the middle of the crisis , the report , which was adopted tomorrow to vote in plenary . 
there are , in my view , at least three reasons . 
firstly , we have a responsibility towards our electorate . 
the second is in the knowledge that the current crisis us on the eve of enlargement as a lesson we must serve . 
the third reason is , after all , in our intention , a clarification of the policy of the transatlantic cooperation , which the Member States to take it appears that , with many of us in the hope that the current differences , seem more serious than they are . 
the first reason , the responsibility to our electorate . 
for all of us Eurobarometerumfragen known for years , it is clear that a majority of two thirds of the European citizens a common security and defence policy . 
as our fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , this mood are aware , it was only natural that they should be in a similar percentage share . 
this was the case in the vote in committee , the after a full debate , as it was almost 200 amendments . 
in our new Rules of Procedure , would be a simple vote in Parliament have been possible , but in view of the importance of this issue we were unanimous agreement of the opinion that the current debate is justified , in which we are also the Council and the Commission wanted to . 
in this debate , we identified great value , in order - and this is my second point - without further delay learn the lessons of the current crisis . 
Europe was not in the situation , in the United Nations Security Council to speak with one voice , such as this according to the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty would have been his duty . 
this is not proof , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that it is now time for the our institutions in future to change the confusion and , in order to prevent the Kakophonie , who are beginning to - but , as I hope only temporarily - in the coexistence of the Member States have made a ? 
as you know , the citizens expect , as I have already said , but perhaps more throughout the world , that Europe its place in the construction of a multipolar political world , in order to prevent the fate of our planet still only to be borne by the President of the United States . 
I now come to my third and most important point . 
Europe is prepared to take the responsibility of what we expect ? 
I am not sure . 
the decision before us today is that it is in any case clearer than ever before . 
either the Member States such as the cold war alone to its defence of the forces of the United States . 
in this case the Americans can hardly lessons in how Washington intends to these armed forces . 
or but they accept what the United States have always of them , i.e. the burden to share , which is , of course , a greater contribution to the joint efforts . 
NATO Secretary-General , Lord Robertson recently referred in your presence , Commissioner Patten , on the gap between the European governments declared ambition and the resources , they are prepared for their implementation . 
he described this as the gap of ambition . 
I hope that the current crisis will help to make aware of this gulf them and they lead , with their eradication . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament , the recent crisis in Iraq has quite made it clear , where , which is in Europe , particularly in the field of foreign affairs and defence . 
let us not , however , in the weaknesses of Europe are . 
this crisis which can also be a creative effect on the European policies , and that is why I believe that the report Morillon very timely , even if this still do not show up its time . 
in today &apos; s time , we must , as the old system of the existence of two superpowers has collapsed , new security policy strategies and measures . 
in view of this fact , the dissemination of weapons of mass destruction is not the only Krisenherd . 
this is not the only risk , through the global security and stability are being threatened . 
grassierende poverty , organised crime , institutionalised violence and serious economic crises are equally damaging to the global stability and safety as military or terrorist activities . 
of course we have to look at the same time , to what extent and at what stage we in the light of this dangers the right political measures . 
in addition to all of us elected response , we believe that it is absolutely essential that the global security on mutual trust , cooperation and the consensus in international organisations , pushing and networks . 
the method that we have with threats to global security , our future , if we are building peace and a healthy economic environment ensure and convincing answers to global political , economic and ecological problems . 
I would like to take the opportunity , with a view to the Irak-Krise , I am delighted that the extremely interesting report by General Morillon the Presidency has given the opportunity to reflect the opinions of the Council , to a for European integration subject as important as the European security and defence policy , is to say . 
both the report , Mr Morillon , as well as other relevant initiatives , as the report , Mr Barnier , have valuable ideas offered us , particularly in the for the Intergovernmental Conference planned debate , but also at the moment , as can be of use in the competent authorities of the Council &apos; s draft documents which the integration of the ESVP-Mechanismus . this is , of course , also for the convention . 
I should like to point out here , and I declare the same why that some of the report Morillon expressed ideas initiatives , which are already on the way and have been brought by the competent bodies of the Union . 
I will in the debate with the current threats to safety , the stability and peace , to start by different as the threats are familiar from the past . 
the ESVP-Mechanismus was , in order to tell the truth , not from the outset , to horizontal and irrational threats , such as the terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to deal with the mechanism careful and gradually to the current security environment must be adapted . 
consequently , were the first steps , concrete targets : the use of the forces of the Union for the protection against terrorist attacks on the civilian population , on the one hand , and their use in war zones on the other . 
are there is no doubt that the development and the improvement of the military capabilities of the cornerstone of the security and therefore of the defence of the Union . 
we devote special attention to this subject matter , and in the context of the continuation of the so far , efforts is planned , a conference on the ability to convene in the implementation of the action plan , the ECAP , to assess the progress made and to note and in order to decide what should be moved forward . 
the presidency has produced a text , which contains the guidelines after the completion of the work of the relevant working groups , the ECAP-Panels , to do . 
we hope that these initiatives , a new impulse our operational capability to improve the military sector and also to help the foundations for the further development of ESDP . 
in this respect , it is of particular importance to the rapid reaction force , which is why this issue of the Spanish Presidency in the priorities in the field of the military aspect of the ESDP has been included . 
the operational framework of the establishment and action of the rapid reaction force will be determined by the competent political and military authorities , and we do any effort , until the end of the Greek presidency to complete . 
it goes without saying that the strengthening of the military capabilities of the Union will be possible if we and our cooperation in the Rüstungsbereich . 
this project , of course , already would be planned in the past , but now is the time , it is implemented , and the European Union sets foot in new here . 
the decision of the European Council is in two parts : firstly , the Council , the role of the Verteidigungsforschung and the development of the relevant capabilities of the Union in a more general framework to be monitored and , secondly , the possibility of setting up a European Rüstungsagentur , an intergovernmental European authority . 
these two projects are important steps towards strengthening cooperation on defence . 
the Verteidigungsforschung can , the expectation is that , with the policies of the European Union in terms of competitiveness , in order to be linked with appropriate evidence many sectors and the development forward as well as greater enlargement . 
with the same intention is also the development of a comprehensive Weltraumpolitik of the Union , which is to be implemented in the Sicherheitssektor , which also in the report Morillon has been raised . 
the developments in the last decade , makes it clear that there are many joint risks , and we need a coordinated joint response . 
for this reason , it is necessary to have a common information system security policy , and why the creation of a system of common political and military training for crisis management for the Presidency is of interest , and we have been working . 
the report Morillon said idea of a civil peace corps , is a very good idea , especially as this will help to make aware of the European average citizen , what is happening in the Sicherheitssektor and how we deal in practical level , and we have to take part in this . 
this idea we looked at carefully , and the presidency will most likely a draft with the relevant guidelines . 
a basic element of European security is no doubt that the European Union &apos; s relationship with NATO . 
the European option in crisis management is in any case , first of all , to the will and the Handlungsbereitschaft the regional and international organisations to call , in other words , the dialogue has priority . 
the recent agreement on cooperation between the European Union and NATO is an important step towards mutual complement and support of the two organisations . 
I would like to use this opportunity to say , in the report by Mr Morillon , to emphasise that the activities of the two organisations and its members of the principles of the United Nations Charter determined and must be done . 
ladies and gentlemen , as I have already said , these points , both in the report , Mr Morillon , as well as the objectives of the Presidency , and that is why we are trying to it . 
however , there is no doubt that the report , is a wide range of ideas , and the very important issues and institutional aspects of the ESDP , so that a remarkable contribution to our debate . 
I do not intend to dwell on each of these in the report containing ideas , despite the fact that many of them very interesting . for the implementation of these ideas , institutional reforms , which is currently in the context of the convention and then discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference to be addressed . 
however , I am sure that it as a valuable source of inspiration and consideration will be of benefit . 
we are in a decisive turning point . 
the Europäsche Union has the courageous companies in the enlargement and must , therefore , with a firm step for an extension of its policies , so that they provide on the basis of other factors than in the past can go to the other way . 
the overwhelming majority of Europeans expects this , as Mr Morillon in his report . 
the time actually require Entschlussfähigkeit and Handlungswillen , the aim is , at the end of the defence identity of the European Union . 
this will allow the European Union to strengthen their safety and their foreign policy . 
ladies and gentlemen , the current situation could , in spite of the dark side , the start of a intensive discussion , what the European Union will from now on , in particular , as we are now in the middle of an open debate on the future of Europe . 
these questions are still not clear , and what lessons we also from the reasons , and the development of the Irak-Krise , we must draw scenario , so that we in the future similar situation and try and Europe in the global system can give greater weight . 
Mr President , I would like to start by General Morillon very warmly on his comprehensive - and in any case highly topical - contribution to the debate on the development of the European security and defence policy . 
on the topical , both my and honourable friend as the Minister of the Council Presidency rightly pointed out . 
the number of amendments , the committee before the adoption of this resolution , has done is of great interest in many respects , frankly but also the different views on this Schlüsselbereichs of European policy . 
in my own answer , the current competences of the Commission in security and defence issues . 
I will certainly take account of them , and I do not do this , then I will remind you , Mr Van Orden to them . 
irrespective of what future recommendations of the convention , in the my colleague , Commissioner Barnier the talks on defence issues informed has done - and I know that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , in the course of the discussions on this report has informed - the competences of the Commission is currently in relation to the many in this text subjects dealt with very limited . 
the Commission is not to the purely military aspects of the European security and defence policy . 
this is only the Member States . 
for this reason I am not going to the specific military proposals , such as the setting up constantly einsatzbereiter forces , the inclusion of a clause to the collective defence or the creation of a common Militärakademie . 
in the Treaty , the Commission will , however , with the ESDP in connection with this - Article 27 contains a clear reference - and we are actively involved in all the discussions on operations of crisis management in the context of the ESDP , particularly in terms of the instruments for civil conflict management is concerned , for example , policing , strengthening the rule of law and civil administration and civil protection . 
in this context , I am pleased to say that the resolution we have before us sends out the importance of civil and military contributions to crisis management . 
however , it is not possible - and this point , I have on several occasions in this House presented , purely military aspects of the problems that are associated to separate , for which we in the Commission is responsible and which we have a real contribution to make . 
military and non-military aspects are not cannot in different dissociate clean . 
and they should it , because it is an overall strategy in the service must be coordinated closely linked . 
the Commission can , for example , the support of the police forces in the wake of conflicts , such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the European Union on 1 January the police mission has adopted by the UN , or we could look at the training of Grenzschützern in regions , which uncontrolled Massenmigration leads to conflict , we could also , as in the past , in the Balkans and topical in Afghanistan , the reconstruction of administrative structures in countries which have just behind a conflict . 
the Commission has already have a lot of choice of instruments and Fachkenntnissen , which can be used in crisis situations . 
as General Morillon , could new instruments of the European Union to security as necessary . 
but the most important condition is that all the available instruments in any situation for the implementation agreed political objectives of the European Union should be used . 
I must say that the current events show that this is not the case for a long time . 
another area in which the Commission must take a very important role , relates to the strategy for Rüstungsfragen . 
I believe that we can and should Rüstungshandel and -produktion within the internal market is not a &apos; closed Jagdgründe . &apos; 
the procurement of Wehrtechnik , the competition between Rüstungsfirmen , research and development , education and imports of Verteidigungsgütern aspects of the Rüstungshandels , talking about dual-use goods and , on a civilian and military benefits have , these are all areas in which the advantages of the internal market for the European industry are important . 
this is still very can be improved . 
the Commission has recently adopted a communication to the Council and Parliament for Verteidigungsgüterindustrie , adopted in the it refers to a number of areas in which fundamental progress made possible by the taxpayers in the European Union a greater added value for their in the safety of that money . 
the concerns about a Duplizierung and fragmentation of the production and procurement , of course and a lack of interoperability - which the resolution before us will be raised - some of the key issues to which we wanted to address in our communication . 
our hope is that we with our on the communication can help follow-up initiated a strong and competitive defence industry , transparent market conditions and a climate for investment in the for a strengthening of the ESDP necessary research and development projects . 
ultimately , the credibility of the common foreign and security policy in large part of the military capacity of the European Union . 
the creation of a 60 000 men strong &apos; Rapid Reaction Force &apos; in the context of the ESDP will certainly to strengthen the European credibility abroad . 
in addition , the adoption of the first Militäroperation of the European Union in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last month , that the ESDP not merely a theoretical construction . 
I agree , however , my friend General Morillon entirely that our allies , that Europe will be difficult to take seriously if we do not invest more in our security . 
the argument that Europe is its share of costs , by a large proportion of the world development aid funds - even if this is , of course , is true - or by the humanitarian aid pursued even further , is not enough . 
we must also more in the development of our spheres of operation in the form of Lufttransportkapazitäten , special teams and Gefechtskommunikationstechnik . 
if we do not do this , we will continue to our partners in the opinion that Europe his Friedensdividende after the fall of the Berlin wall to make has quickly . 
the main task of aid organisations should still in the provision of aid , the neutrality , independence and impartiality such humanitarian operations . 
a respect for these principles is for the satisfaction of humanitarian needs in essential . 
for this reason , the Commission welcomes the fact that the report on the guidelines for the deployment of military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten within the framework of humanitarian UN-Operationen in complex emergencies , on 20 March 2003 were published by the UN . 
it is clear rules on the relationship between military and humanitarian operators in humanitarian UN-Operationen . 
the Hauptaussagen the guidelines for the use of European military and civil Verteidigungskapazitäten in humanitarian operations . 
I would like to make one last comment about the humanitarian law , the military action . 
we believe that the humanitarian law for the conflicts of today &apos; s time , provided that the Kriegsparteien and all the signatories of the Geneva Convention , to their obligations . 
I should like at this stage to the recognition of the Commission with regard to the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross as subsidiary parties and guardians of the Convention . 
finally , I would like to my honourable friend say once more that this report to almost painful way is topical . 
it raises a number of questions , which are directly on our credibility in Europe , and if we take the effort in the coming years , a greater contribution in international affairs . but , as I have already said on previous occasions in this House , have said a moment in the policy in which we implement its will . 
in relation to security we have this time has been long exceeded . 
Mr President , in the wake of Commissioner Patten , I should like to say that the report of Mr Morillon , in fact , it is exactly the right time . 
in the last few weeks was presented to us is the de facto powerlessness of the European Union and the various Member States , together in the field of defence a much role to play . 
the criticism of the United States , America should not as Weltpolizist , is in fact of the strange , even those who are not in themselves contain anything like this in the situation and , in fact , often are not prepared . 
in particular , we have the experience in Yugoslavia taught us , where the European countries from &apos; Friedfertigkeit &apos; and &apos; modesty &apos; they commented publicly , but from &apos; cynicism &apos; and &apos; indifference &apos; . 
this hypocrisy is gradually from this Parliament have disappeared . 
we all have clearly recognised , in my opinion , that Europe responsibility in the defence cultures , and this - in any way whatsoever , has said . 
it is to be hoped that it really happen . 
only on the organisations of the European Union and in cooperation with the transatlantic partners , it is possible to fulfil this task . 
these two must , of course , always in a breath . 
they are closely linked component . 
the stronger the transatlantic trust , the greater the internal the unity of the European Union . 
in this area in the European Union often i.e. conflict is dispose with our attitude to the United States , our transatlantic partner . 
therefore , the combination of these two a very important element , also in the report by General Morillon . 
it is a realistic way to a European Verteidigungsverantwortung , and because of its experience as General knows exactly that military actions , always in the first and then necessary civil actions buried as they are . 
in view of the now raubend and plündernd by the roads Bagdads ziehenden Mobs is fully aware of this . 
in addition to a successful &apos; s action must therefore take immediately to civil level . 
the decision on such a cautious , realistic way is , for example , by common research and development , by means of a common definition of the from a European perspective existing military needs . 
this is , of course , always a new departure , and in many countries , it will be difficult for us , but it is of the utmost importance . 
for the production of this is extremely important . 
this is the effectiveness of the Verteidigungsanstrengungen be strengthened considerably . 
if the search for a European point of view of the responsibility which we in the field of defence , our starting point , can also be gained the confidence of all the Member States . 
no one is in order to respond to the question put this great country , which should be nachgefolgt : France , Germany , Great Britain , and the United States . 
it is important that we in the European Union a common European position in Militärangelegenheiten . 
in addition the report by Mr Morillon a unmissverständlicher impulse . 
he acted so that , in fact , a before method , as recommended by Commissioner Patten , namely the borders of the us by the Treaties of bringing about opportunities . 
and thorough examination of this will at some point it is a wall , then we do , to which , as a reform must be and what institutional changes to decide . 
I myself consider that always has for a very practical way , and General Morillon has also decided . 
for a European Verteidigungsverantwortung are the prospects for , of course , still not particularly helpful . 
the developments , which we have seen recently , we have shown that the Member States and the members of the Council itself not even a serious idea of the Council . 
otherwise would imply , for example , the Greek presidency currently initiatives taken in this area in a much greater role to play . 
we must not to the possibility of a Auseinanderfallens of the European Union in two groups , each with a closer cooperation . 
in short , it is incredibly important that the European defence at the request of the citizens , as well as General Morillon writes , shape . 
this will allow a more efficient use of the budget , and this is directly to all citizens to success . 
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , two years after the report , which I had the honour of our House at the same subject , I should like to present today with pleasure my full support for the report by Mr Morillon . 
after the adoption , as we hope , some of our group amendments tabled by the adoption of the motion for a resolution well without difficulties to be arranged . 
I shall therefore limit myself to a number of points out , the me in the context of this very turbulent spring 2003 to be particularly important . 
in this context is not good for the fledgling European security and defence policy , the ESDP . 
since 11 September 2001 is the European Union in political and military terms , to marginalisation a large extent , be it in the Afghanistan- or the Irakfrage or with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
our presence is not zero , but it is reduced in civil and humanitarian actions . 
this is important , but it is not enough . 
far worse is , however , that in this period divisions within the Union . 
despite the commendable efforts of the Greek Presidency , the adoption of common positions , to be shared the opinions in the Irakfrage , both in terms of the kind of our transatlantic relations and our Grades to autonomy , with regard to the United States , as a corollary - with regard to certain fundamental principles of the use of violence , the importance of international law or the role of the United Nations . 
in spite of this dark situation loudly and clearly , I would like to express my conviction that we must give under any circumstances . 
some countries , Belgium , Germany , France and Luxembourg , have already launched an initiative of the security and defence policy , in order to relaunch . 
Greece , which the Unionsvorsitz of the Council , has responded positively , as the Prime Minister stated Simitis recently . 
I hope that the convention with its chairman Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing after a few weeks of secrecy and hesitation in this issue , too , proposals . 
excellent ideas on the institutions of the foreign , security and defence policy are already been said by Mr Dehaene and Mr Barnier has developed , moreover , with the views expressed by Parliament . 
and today in the report , Mr Morillon , a whole range of interesting proposals , for example , to the objectives of the CFSP and the ESDP under the new international conditions , on the new role of NATO , the relations between the European Union and NATO , the military capabilities , particularly in the Hochtechnologiebereich simply need to be credible . 
of course , it is not a question of compete with the United States . 
that would be completely unwise and impossible . 
rather , it is a certain basically simple situation to be taken into account . 
because of its geographical proximity and its common borders are in fact security in the countries of Europe together . 
because of its traditions , particularly in cultural point of view , they have important values and principles to defend in the world . 
finally , the Europeans because of its resources and the economic policy instruments which they have put in place , in a position to spread its ideas and their interests , if necessary , to defend throughout the world , if they wish to . 
in short , the Europeans have quite simply a role to play in the world , without this , but we also want to dominate without any subordination and without a whatever sort of Untertänigkeitsverhältnis . 
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , do you ! 
this is in line with the wishes of Parliament , which will support you . 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Morillon regrets that I in his opening of the debate . 
this report could not be more topical . 
if , as is probably - the American and British forces now have the control of Baghdad , then the debate on the impact of the war and to ziehenden lessons from the start . 
in contrast to its predecessors shows the current administration only low level of interest in a strong and unified Europe . 
our weakness is bloßgelegt cruelly , and it is the duty of the EU to develop a Sicherheitsstrategie us in the redefine the transatlantic relations can be helpful . 
the members of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party in this House welcome the report by Mr Morillon as an important contribution to this process . 
the European differences of opinion on the subject of Iraq have made it clear that we are not able , in terms of security issues to speak with one voice , however , we should not forget that Europe on a common trade policy , a joint development policy and on a particularly entstehendes diplomatic corps in the form of Kommissionsbüros in the world . 
these are powerful instruments , which is still much stronger if they could be seen as part of an integrated foreign policy linked with each other . 
our foreign policy is inconsistent , because it on three Commissioners , the Council presidency and the High Representative of the Council is distributed and because some Member States to deny that we have fundamental common interests in the field of foreign policy , or the Commission , to take a leading role . 
without a common defence policy , it is Europe in the for a credible common foreign policy necessary military influence . 
our common defence expenditure to less than half of the expenditure of the United States and make it clear that the EU not invest enough in the defence of our citizens have higher Verteidigungsetats would welcome . 
it will not be enough to invest more simply : we must use the funding more effectively , especially for fundamental requirements as strategic Lufttransporte , Präzisionslenkwaffen and Tankflugzeuge . 
that is why the Liberal Group supports the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency armament and research to control the defence budgets . 
we want to be more economical and , if the EU countries also think that , outside the EU produced supplying arms are able to meet our criteria and the cheapest , then we should not in a fehlgeleiteten Anflug of protectionism European option . 
in this way we would be repeating the mistakes of the common agricultural policy . 
more effective defence expenditure must come up with a greater decision making . 
Parliament cannot with its clear and unanimous message in favour of a strong and effective European Security and Defence Policy to the European Convention in the form of the report of General Morillon hope influence on the discussions . 
by the appointment of a single representative for Foreign Affairs , the from the ranks of the Commission , but additional resources and know-how from the Member States , we will be a great deal of progress in the links between the grundverschiedenen elements in the field of foreign and security policy . 
we also have a greater flexibility in the introduction and implementation of crisis management of the day and giving if necessary , for the constructive abstention . 
there are clear reservations about this possibility , but the introduction of a clause to the collective defence in the new constitution-treaty , similar to that of the Treaty on the Western European Union , clause contained also seems to be necessary . 
this may not progress with all 15 Member States , let alone with 25 Member States . 
that is why I welcome the initiative of the Belgian government , in this month a meeting with France , Germany and Luxembourg to issues of defence policy . 
progress in the European integration can often only by the determined use a group of determined countries , which is a matter moving and the other countries . 
nevertheless , I am of the opinion that a greater cooperation in relation to defence all the governments , which is to take part in this must be open to continue and that the British Government in particular , because of its military capacity and experience will . 
finally , I would like to point out that a European security and defence policy by NATO guaranteed collective Sicherheitsstruktur supplement can , as long as there is a rationalisation of the Rüstungsbeschaffung , a added value in the form of a doctrine on the basis of conflict prevention and crisis management and a credible threatened use of military measures and a much more coherent and common approach to the security policy . 
let us our Security and Defence Policy , on the Amboss of hope and from the steel our ashamed with a view to Iraq . 
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Morillon , that he at the beginning of his report has pointed out , as the guiding principle of the European foreign and security policy . 
in its considerations he says - in my opinion , and rightly so - that the crisis must be the guiding principle . 
only in emergency situations , only the European Union is in crisis situations of military resources . 
it is precisely this order is supported by my group , and that is why we are also in favour of , for example , the use of the European Union in Macedonia and Bosnia . 
this means that the European Union , finally , I would say , on the were last resources in the Gesamtspektrum of foreign and defence policy instruments . 
in addition to the diplomacy , in addition to economic resources now military resources , but if you please in this order . 
I would like to highlight two chapters of the report closer . 
first of all , the General - in my opinion rightly - by means of an amendment proposed that a certain point in his report to the speech already as yet , which is the need for a strategic approach . 
what are the specific objectives of the European security policy ? 
where do we want ? 
what we need this ? 
when we want to do this ? 
such an approach , I believe that this is a very good report . 
I am also an absolute advocates a review of the Petersberg tasks - that the official description of our in my opinion , far too limited strategic approach . 
I am , however , like to begin to , and then only , for example , to discuss the territorial defence , including in the report by Mr Morillon , in my view , only volatile comments . 
now suddenly to the tasks of the European Union to be added ? 
we need to Article 5 of the WEO-Vertrags ? 
I believe that such a decision to be premature . 
first of all , we should deal with the strategic approach and then to consider what these European instruments should be achieved . 
similarly , I think it would be too early to say , in the year 2009 should we be able to a task as in Kosovo . 
only the examination of the strategic concept and then the adoption of this type of specific tasks . 
secondly , another important point of the report which often existing misunderstanding , although , as well as the contributions of Mr Patten and Mr Watson a little angeklungen - said that we are not sufficient financial means for the vorzusehenden actions available to us . 
the problem , ladies and gentlemen , is not that too little money is available , but that it is not enough and efficient enough and that it will be used in a so far has been Arbeitsspezialisierung . 
where the problem lies . 
let us manner . 
I am very pleased that it is also in the report by Mr Morillon expressed clearly . 
with regard to the financing begrüßenswerterweise - I am in favour of the rapporteur - the gradual transferring the funding of , in my view , completely non-transparent national Ad-hoc-Haushalten between Member States , the any democratic control , to the EU budget . 
there are many arguments as to whether it is only the impact on the European defence policy , the European Parliament , at last , in this respect , as the defence expenditure will be financed from the Community budget . 
finally , I would like to a point of my main concern is . 
in this Parliament , and also with the Council , we are agreed that the effectiveness of should be increased . 
we must be able to act faster and more efficient . 
I agree , ladies and gentlemen , but then , if you please on the basis of a specific strategic plan . 
my fear is , however , that a fundamental Zubehör , namely the democratic control , it is a lack of . 
a further increase the effectiveness and improve our potential without clarity about where the security policy democratically controlled , is not . 
if we are in favour of the majority of Parliament - and I think that qualified majority voting in the field of security policy , then we must want - in the exercise of democratic control of the European Parliament cannot be excluded . 
effectiveness is necessary , but if you please , together with democratic control , and this must be ultimately here in this Chamber . 
Mr President , the recent international events have once again shown how urgent it a European Union , of the need for the closed action is capable of both if it is to defend their own safety , and , if need be , the right of each people to the quest for a democratic and pluralist , the human rights and to protect the rights of wahrenden system , a Europe which , at last , the diplomacy - the diplomatic services - and the provision of each Member State , together with those cooperation , which the Council is aware of the need , with the problems of the world politics , in order to be able to reach decisions which , as far as possible the whole of the Union . 
it is primärer importance , the whole of the foreign and security policy debate and the subsequent ableitenden decisions in the framework of the Council . 
it is also of primärer importance , a single European representative for these two areas of policy . 
with this subject has also aware of the convention . 
by some Member States are actually outside of the Council &apos; s meetings are held , legitimate initiatives , but they are not initiatives of the European Union . 
that is why it is obvious that we are facing a European security and defence policy , which is also a military instrument , such as that of Mr Morillon &apos; s proposed peace and democracy , can guarantee our support . 
this European forces to be the national armed forces of all the Member States will arise , and also to the development of citizenship an additional impetus , because this is from the alia Inter feel proud that every citizen , whether its belonging to his country and to the European Union must feel : a free and independent European Union , winner of a project of peace and mutual respect for the rest of the world , a project , not only on the presentation of documents , noble declarations of intent or the production of trade , but must be based with proper powers for the fight against terrorism and the defence of our values of our vision of the world and our freedom has been institutions . 
Mr President , it is always the same again . 
if the European Chimären &apos; s downfall of the real , then develop our &apos; europabewegten &apos; Träumer absurdere ideas , new immediately , in a headlong , the ridiculous , would it not dangerous . 
with the report , Mr Morillon us today is the myth which places of a European defence , which , moreover , presented an old hat one can . 
it was the whole of the twentieth century through the dream of einfältigen Geistern - without any practical result . 
already Aristide Briant widespread this idea with the dramatic result , the opposition and the Verteidigungsbereitschaft in France . 
this was 1948 fixe idea on the Congress in The Hague aufgetischt again and then 1950 of a certain Winston Churchill with the EVG , the from its Träumereien was born and key brake . 
we must , moreover , the French Parliament , which is to put an end to it . 
fifty years later , we are still in the same , in other words , there are no progress has been made . 
we have even as little progress that the key element of a common defence policy , the establishment of a European defence industry - not only not make progress , but a backward step , since , as we hardly must remember the majority of Europeans to buy weapons with each other but not to approximately 60 % of the United States . 
this would be a beginning , if we want a defence policy should be . 
however , these defence policy is a myth which places , because there is no defence policy without a common foreign policy . 
this may be in 1992 ehernen credit in title V of the Maastricht Treaty , but it is in any crisis , either in Rwanda , in Afghanistan , even in Kosovo , has been achieved . 
this is because we have not been able to work together all hinterherliefen blind to the United States . 
and now they platzt once again , the common foreign and security policy . 
we should no longer these Chimären nachlaufen . 
Europe must be based on the reality . 
and the realities , such as today more than ever , the Member States will be visible . 
this must not one of its main components allow : the desire to defence and the necessary resources . 
I will confine myself here to express the wish that France , whose global responsibility to widen , will be able to strengthen its own Verteidigungsmittel , because this is the only one that the best contribution to the what Europe still remains . 
Mr President , with the words of a French Komikers : to talk about everything is in all , and vice versa . 
in view of the obvious collective failure of the so-called European Union in areas such as economic growth and employment , the rapporteur , unfortunately , it seems to forget that he General of the French army is , for a Verteidigungskonzept a purely and simply a gradual implementation France to a level would mean that , at the moment , if anything , the Belgium will entirely meet . 
this will , of course , tirelessly of all those from various reasons , the concept of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; the possibility of a up against stumbling blocks , to restore European unification process . 
the current war in Iraq should , however , for all these Schöngeister at long last , be an opportunity to take on board the fact that the nations kaltblütige monster , the only in their own interests . 
the recent failure of the European Transportflugzeugs , that is a much more quickly and much cheaper , which can be produced would have had endless Geschachere at the GALILEO project , the extremely high costs each Rüstungsfabrikation on multinational basis , the fate of hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are being threatened - all that has no significance for these Berufspolitiker , whose only aim is , as long as possible in power . 
the enlarged Europe needs stability , but this cannot , of course , be achieved by new legal Kunstgriffe , unpraktizierbare cooperation , unfähige organisms , supposed power or Vortäuschungen are . 



whatever our current differences of opinion on the Nahostproblematik all Eurosceptic without exception and without reservations this fixe idea of a &apos; Europe as a power &apos; . 
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it has always been my dream , after a de Gaulle to talk about , but not for a that such speeches . 
we are now , when we this debate on the future of European security and defence policy , seen the war in Iraq . we believed that this war with diplomatic means to prevent . 
but we are , because we across the political and military existent because we do not . 
when it comes to war or peace , once again , we were not prepared . 
we too late , as in Bosnia , as in Kosovo or , as in Afghanistan . 
in any of these armed conflicts , the European Union , as an international player , the mitbestimmt . 
that is why it is one of the Kernsätze of the report , Mr Morillon , that only a Union with clearly defined foreign policy objectives and interests , equipped with effective military capability , that counts . 
just such a Union can a self-employed player in world politics and a selbstbewusster partners in the transatlantic relations . 
there is now so many head of government , given its powerlessness in the Irak-Krieg öffentlichkeitswirksam now he believes that the objective of European Verteidigungsunion thereof . 
I wonder whether this Government because it is not to the decisions taken since Helsinki in 1999 involved ? 
why did they do not do more , so that the Rapid Einsatztruppe , on the ball 2003 as the EU at the latest technology and with the relevant Kommandostrukturen and transport capacity ; ? 
why has the Anpassungsreform their national armed forces behind the new Sicherheitsherausforderungen back ? 
why were the seeing in this way reversed ? 
why did you for the transport of its own soldiers in their own country to the Flugzeugvermieter Ukraine ? 
the European Parliament has continually since 1999 , that the foreign policy instruments of the Union to be supplemented military capability . 
of course , it is now in the convention . 
this report is also the European Parliament &apos; s contribution to the future : how can the European Union to protect the safety of its citizens with new threats by terrorism and how can the European Union to peace and stability in the world ? 
because Präventivkriege without legitimacy we must never again ! 
that is why we support in this report all those who , in the Convention for the updating of the Petersberg tasks that are in favour of a vanguard of Member States military Krisenmissionen can take for a kind of European Rüstungsagentur , for a European Beistands- and Solidaritätsklausel and in particular , the crucial point in the majority decision-making in the foreign policy and closer cooperation in the defence policy to introduce . 
we believe , however , the governments should be clear on the following : millions of people have in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges in the roads of the cities of Europe demonstrated in favour of that war and peace , but parliaments no Kabinette have to decide . 
whoever facility of a European Einsatztruppe decides needs a very high level of democratic legitimacy . 
let me a final opinion , all future facility in the context of the ESDP will be given a civil and military part . 
it is precisely this is what we are of the NATO . 
in Bosnia , we have now with a police mission . 
perhaps we solve next year , the SFOR-Mission of NATO . 
we can cohesion between civil and military operations , if the best means of ensuring for both the same rules , and the common costs on the budget of the European Union . 
this has to do with parliamentary control , but for their gain governments also democratic support and support for their actions . 
the citizens of the European Union has already been said , in any case , Mr Morillon , in the report , of course , the concept of a European defence policy . 
71 % of the people of Europe . 
only the Kabinette have not yet understood . 
Mr President , I would also like to Mr Morillon , on his excellent report , and I can already tell you that I can , some of the objectives and proposals for support . 
as has already been said , the debate to find an appropriate time . 
the war in Iraq , Europe has divided . 
that is why , in the public opinion , doubts as to the ability of the European Union , going to außereuropäischer level to speak with one voice . 
today &apos;s debate on the European defence policy is , therefore , to a very dubious this at the moment . 
the idea are , however , not silent , and without new initiatives can be wiedergutgemacht damage does not angerichtete . 
in the European Convention is currently on the strengthening of the Beschlussfassungsstrukturen . 
the report , Mr Morillon , contains a whole series of practical proposals to improve the Verteidigungsfähigkeit of the EU . 
we support the enlargement of the Petersberg tasks , which is also include the fight against terrorism . 
the Schnelleingreiftruppe must be given more attention . 
if , in future , truly independent operations of this force to be possible to do this , it is also a more efficient organisation of the defence industry in Europe . 
in implementation of all these objectives if the European Union , with a useful military capacity . 
the European Union will then have still not a military superpower . 
this is not the intention . 
in the context of a comprehensive security policy with the crisis , the European Union , the simultaneous use of several instruments . 
such a concept is a credible military component . 
the Irakkonflikt has bewusster our weaknesses , but this is no reason for complete amendment of the Grundkonzepts . 
the European Union must , together with other countries , and within multilateral framework , will be able to take their responsibility when it comes to the international legal system . 
the recommendation , the development of the foreign and security policy with a vanguard active Member States to be speeded up , deserves support . 
the pace can no longer by the principle of be determined . 
however , I am in favour of an open process . 
anyone who would like to endorse the opportunity to them . 
Mr President , the report by Mr Morillon deals with the European defence as part of a realistic and responsible strategy of solidarity and complementarity with the United States and is therefore a committed step forward , of the forecasts , economic victims and military investment . 
it is a necessary and urgent step , in which the new terrorist and state threats not be underestimated . 
a Agenda , which is in line with my proposals , which I last year with the study &apos; A European sword &apos; proposals . 
the report avoid dangerous illusion that neither the security and democracy in the world would strengthen the unity of Europe . 
these dangerous illusion the rebirth together a unilateral Pazifismus , a return to the previous unilateral Pazifismus of the &apos; prefer red as dead &apos; . 
a further illusion is one of Europe , the independent , strong and einflussreich is because it is of the United States has losgesagt : an illusion , which is the fault of the USA-feindlichen and for the European supranational policy unempfänglichen Gaullismus , especially in the field of foreign and defence policy . 
it is an illusion , the deep in the European nationalism and in now is rooted in ideologies an illusion , the strange Rechts-Links-Bündnis in relation to the war in Iraq declared and on the other hand , the principle of democratic intervention has magnified . 
these political illusion is more dangerous than the imperiale Unilateralismus and of Pazifismus : the claim that Europe to manage , he has divided ; he has the Fifteen that he has divided the Eastern European countries , while the insulted Wiedervereinigungsprozess was that he has the distance from the United States increased and before the possibility of the right of veto to cripple the Security Council , so that he justifications for the military intervention outside of the UN did . 
before the European Union the development of the institutional system reallocate their political vision , it must be clear ; it is the safety of their population , their own territory and its borders ensure - and it has failed in the Balkans - it must be the erosion of the Rüstungskontrolle and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to bloody dictatorships to recognise , and they must strongly against terrorism and for the safety of Israel and a democratic Palestinian State . 
if the Union a neither unterwürfige still hostile , neither resigned still dependent allies of the United States , it must be a common defence and gradual the leadership of the Atlantic Alliance , in which the United States now only 8 % of their armed forces have committed . 
in order to do this , it is of the agreement of Saint-Malo between France and Great Britain and of this report by Philippe Morillon , because they today the culmination of the development of the European security policy , the fragile , and on the whole of the Union must be extended . 
Mr President , we should today , as we speak about the European security and guarantee the future how we can make sure to us all . 
in particular in the last few years and on 11 September , we have seen that military weapons no guarantee of security . 
on the contrary , we could say because , if a country in the world is ready military well , it is the United States on 11 September have become victims of a Terroraktion . 
this terrorist attack by the previous weapons has therefore not be prevented . 
the Rechtsruck , which is in the United States has taken place in this area , heaven forbid the security considerations in Europe . 
there is - global and within the EU - a complete discrepancy between the investment in military equipment and our investment in a truly sustainable security . 
the problem is that the report Morillon these abuses not eliminated , as one of the reasons for this is that I cannot support it in the final analysis , although he many good and right analyses , on the need for a European identity in these areas . 
but if these identity is something that we should be to follow what is already rejected , has proved ineffective and we are on the wrong track . 
this is not a sign of Pazifismus , because I believe that a people has the right to defend its own rights , and I also believe that it can be situations in which military power to the peace is necessary . 
but the threat that we are facing , not by military means . 
it is in the first place , the desperation of people in a very unfair world , and we should focus our efforts . 
Madam President , allow me to begin by thanking Mr Morillon , for the effort which he has made Zusammentragen the different viewpoints . 
Mrs Frahm from my Group has already stated that the report despite its positive content from three clear reasons can accept . 
the first reason is our dependence of the NATO , a fact that the European Union in addition to the American giants as a Zwerg can be , and , if the European Union , then they need to develop its own personality . 
otherwise , there is no future for the European Union . 
the second reason is the need for , after the end of the war in Iraq deliberate , because we must make it very clear that the current risk in the world the aggressive behaviour of the United States . 
on 20 September did presented by the United States , wars in the whole world . 
the next will Syria , Iran , Korea to the number - who knows ? 
I do not want to name , so that no objectives to suggest . 
it is a major threat of safety . 
my third point is , therefore , the European Union is a fundamental role in the democratic strengthening of the United Nations and of the Security Council must play . 
we also have to work , conflicts in line with the law necessarily before the General Assembly and the UN Security Council - and that to the United States do not . 
the contribution that the European Union has carried out , is a success . 
we are of many countries South America have been said , despite the fact that , in my opinion , completely unjustified - pressure has carried out , the President Mr Aznar , so that the two countries , which are members of the Security Council , the war against Iraq , this dignity and courage way and Europe set an example , peace and international law in favour of a more important than the dangerous Abenteuern of the United States . 
Madam President , in his explanatory statement for an EU armed force writes General Morillon : &apos; the governments of the Member States to continue to the Americans , any wars , and only with questions of peace , then I think the Union must accept that it is the role of the Athens in ancient Rome : is the case in the final analysis , we accept that the wishes of a new Empire &apos; . 
as I prefer Athens , the cradle of culture and of democracy , the separate Rome , which is the enemy of the whole world and , at the end of blood and fire was sinking , while the Greek weiterlebt in all areas of the Olympic Games to the EU-Ratsvorsitz . 
general Morillon wants , that the EU is doing the same as the United States in Kosovo , or perhaps in Iraq or in one of the smaller countries , against the United States in the last century Angriffskriege . 
they want to see that the EU in the entire planet while not accepting , particularly in the Balkans , in the Middle East , in the Caucasus , in Mittelasien and Africa , by taking military action . 
in such a scenario is , of course , no room for non-aligned countries . 
all are bound by a so-called Solidaritätsklausel , and a UN mandate is absolutely no longer be necessary . 
if the EU the Roman way of General Morillon , can it be done , that of a fine day a EU-Präsident alongside the President of the United States debated in what oil and mineralreichen developing country the poor in the next time the Steinzeit zurückgebombt . 
in any attempt to mitzuhalten militärtechnischen area with the United States , but the risk that the lethal arms race of the Soviet Union . 
certainly the Europeans then billion people also attach such as the Americans . 
million will be demonstrators in the EU embassies , the Eiffelturm will be the fate of the World Trade Center , will undermine the UN , the Zivilisationskrieg will spread and the people of Europe , the increasingly , will be the losers , as many Superwaffen following the example of the United States , we move . 
if General Morillon with his views , bring best mentioned the book &apos; The sinking of the Abendlandes &apos; of Oswald Spengler from the Regal , in order to understand what will happen . 
if we , as General Morillon the which aspires to try to build a modern Rome , it is also the fate of Roms . 
no , we are the plans for a military superpower ad once and let us listen to our Sacharow-Preisträger ! 
we take the Dalai Lama &apos; s seriously , our guest was . 
the European Union has only as a factor for a chance of survival and a raison d &apos; être . 
let us take a civil peace corps under EU-Regie . 
instead of making a fool us , we should prefer lessons from the experience of the Member States , which 200 years from wars look . 
the specific characteristics of the European Union is of the peace process . 
should the United States war , to the Americans themselves in blood and fire sink such as the Römer ! 
but let us in the culture and democracy Athens note . 
Madam President , the events of 11 September 2001 , the world remember that we are not a matter of peace and security . 
in this light , it is good that the European countries of the need for accepted , even greater responsibility . 
at stake , namely our own credibility and safety . 
this is not by fluctuation . 
it is the report Morillon was quite right to the view that , in relation to the collective defence NATO bond is essential that , at the same time , however , the development of an autonomous European security and defence policy . 
not to mention the wholly inadequate Verteidigungsanstrengungen in Europe . 
in short , the report , Mr Morillon , shows no clear way . 
what is naheliegender as an adequate contribution of the EU Member States in the NATO ? 
one thing is certainly : in connection with Iraq to implement differences between the European members , as well as the controversial initiative , a group of the European defence policy , not helping to ensure that the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy is currently a credible basis for the safety of the citizens in the countries of Europe . 
these people is with a unanimous strong NATO . 
Madam President , between the drafting of the report , Mr Morillon , and today , important international developments , the effect that the issues of the defence of Europe will no longer be dealt with globally and a uniform manner . 
we can no longer act as if it were up to the establishment of a common defence policy for the purpose of the implementation of a common foreign and security policy of all the Member States . 
the arguments of the Security Council on basic issues have taken place , then the beginning of a further after the war in Kosovo , this time against Iraq , in violation of the provisions of the Charter of San Francisco have the considerable differences clearly , what between the present and future Member States of the European Union in the field of foreign policy . 
it is patently two Konzeptionen of Europe and its role , two types of foreign policy , two opinions of the international order . 
we must take note of this . 
it would be the wrong way forward if we were versteifen only a the circumstances , to see geschuldete crisis , as soon as it has , once again , would enable us to the old approaches and to return to the light of one essentially little semantic games in connection with the CFSP and the ESDP to start again . 
in the future can everything at Union level , with foreign affairs and defence , only the concept of variable geometry . 
to this in no way fakultativen approach is now more . 
it is a variable geometry , which , furthermore , more efficiency and less idle chit-chat . 
the convention should now his talents in this respect . 
in the report , Mr Morillon &apos; s proposals must be between by the recent developments completely obsolet , and those who are still used . 
in the first category , I would , in particular , paragraph 54 that in the proposes that the European Union a permanent seat in the UN Security Council . 
this proposal is clearly contrary to the current needs of Europe , continue to two constant members of the Security Council , so that the two different Konzeptionen , the two different Hauptwege which the countries of Europe , can be expressed . 
in the second heading in my opinion , the proposals to the necessary cooperation , the first in the field of the fight against terrorism , what the consequences of the Irakkrieges is more necessary than ever , and , secondly , in the area of production and the Kaufes must be developed , of course . 
the recent events have also to make it quite clear what damage in Europe , with the ideology of the Friedensdividende has been done . 
I therefore welcome the fact that the concept of Community preference zweckdienlicher way in Mr Morillon , in the report , which has surfaced once again , however , I regret that this with his disappearance in another also strategically important area is coinciding : the CAP , i.e. the competence in the food or , in order to use the American terminology - the Nahrungsmittelwaffe . 
the security of supply , such as the report , Mr Morillon , is to say , must for food as for supplying arms . 
we must ensure that Commissioner Lamy in the negotiations of the Doha-Runde not mind . 
Mr President , we know that discussions on a common European security and defence policy is at the moment , for the supporters of the realistic or even überrealistischen school a kind of wishful thinking . 
however , it is precisely in the current circumstances , this report , with its Denkanstößen of all the more interest . 
in essence , we can only support this report , because it is based on fundamental arguments on the European Parliament and the citizens of the Union , there is agreement in particular , to respect the principles of the UN Charter and the law , to a framework for the guidelines of the common foreign policy , the European Security and Defence Policy , on the need for us that Europe responsibility in the field of security and defence policy , from military assistance for humanitarian Hilfseinsätze , conflict prevention and -lösung to maintaining transatlantischer relations and a multilateral approach . 
I would like , however , that the report perhaps too much in the depth and even some details that are clearly not be too . 
if , for example , paragraph G the Kriegsrecht mentioned , is not clear whether the Geneva Convention now be criticised or not . 
in addition , I do wonder in the present at the question is : should we not more attention to the existing resources must be streamlined , if we merge , Doppelungen our efforts and interoperability between the armed forces of our countries ? 
could the sektorenweise distribution of appropriations for the defence in each country . 
some countries give , 70 % or more for staff and maintenance . 
it could perhaps a joint contribution to a priority , such as the area of research , to modern systems in the rule results which both industry and the economy can be of use . 
having said that this is a debate on a very practical matters , which is now only right . 
Madam President , the events of the last time , show that the EU Member States either now or in the future will be able to the organisation of a common defence to . 
the EU Member States , the members of NATO , represented quite different views in relation to the Irakkrieg , as far as the general attitude of these countries to the new world order , which . 
this makes it difficult to create a common defence policy . 
the neutral Member States and do not want that the EU is to become a military alliance or or a military superpower . 
under these circumstances it would be reasonable if the EU will continue to crisis management and the NATO as a system of collective safety for the EU Member States , the an organisation like this to be . 
Germany , France , Belgium and other gleichgesinnte countries could have a close mutual military cooperation within NATO and a defence community , which is a strong European pillar of the NATO would operate . 
this system would cooperation between Europe and North America , which is very important to us all . 
Europe should have been NATO its own defence identity , but the defence community would cooperate closely with the United States . 
the other EU Member States - both the members of NATO and the neutral , would , in turn , play a role in the transatlantic link and . 
the creation of a defence community could even turn into a more general internal differentiation within the Union on the basis of considerations , the leading French and German experts and politicians have employed over the years . 
then let different institutions to the heart of the Union , such as the German Foreign Minister , Mr Joschka Fischer has proposed . 
Madam President , I believe that all members of the European Parliament on 18 years , the average age is 40 or 50 , and that is why we should not play Zinnsoldaten . 
I am not General and this is not , therefore , I have just been carried out , without my therefore wish to have been appointed to be Unteroffizier . 
I can , however , while I am speaking here , not the Fotografie on the front page of the newspaper &apos; s &apos; s Guardian by my internal eye , which shows where these conduct preventative wars use . 
and I can also not from my memory , what I have seen on television five minutes , namely a people , not only for days bombing , but it is up to the redundant has been out of humiliation borders with plundering , theft and all the what we in the TV with . 
do we want given these circumstances , visitors here before journalists , before the interpreters on arms and mechanisms , rather than to discuss our attention to , where we are ? 
we can accept paragraph 17 in the &apos; krisenpräventiven nature &apos; military actions , if a preventative war that is what Mr Bush and Blair in Iraq have begun ? 
we can accept paragraph 9 , which states that terrorism the idea of geografisch limited military commitments lapses and the traditional distinction between the policy of the external and internal security ironed out ? 
what do we do ? 
we are opening even wide open the door to a war in Syria , in Iran , in North Korea and later , Mr Morillon , in France . 
for this reason , this is a useful debate . 
to see where we face . 
not to say that it is bad for us to be divided over . 
to say that what the two sides of the European Union right . 
the side of the principles of the Charter in the United Nations Security Council , the or violates a action in accordance with the UN has supported ? 
the political basis on which we analyse the European Union , which is not a real caricature of the United States will be , but a Pol of peace , the diplomacy and the restrained action in a twenty-first century , which , in any of the twentieth century same . 
Madam President , Commissioner , as has been aware that Europe , despite the fact that it is the most important commercial power is only a very important role to play in the world , if it on a common foreign and security policy , the so-called third pillar in the Treaty of Maastricht and the creation of einsatzbereiter militärsicher capacity to the objective of ensuring peace . 
in a world which is increasingly global and vernetzter , it is so far been our policy , international law to establish , especially the United Nations , but also on other global organisations . we therefore have a legal framework for the international relations is being redesigned , because we are convinced that this is the best way possible conflicts to prevent and deal with them . 
and we believe that the European Union within this world order , should speak with one voice them as a trade , economic and social power and a great defender of the human rights , the Multikulturalismus caveat so and the environment . 
the reality of our current situation , however , is disappointing . 
once again on the division of the internal has at various summits made grandiose statements by the Heads of State and Government prevailed . 
I refer to the different positions which the fifteen countries in the United Nations Security Council to the conflict in Iraq have represented . 
the behaviour of Mr Aznar , the Spanish head of government , and various others , would be as reprehensible alone , therefore , because it to call this division . because rather than on the adoption of a common position adopted by the Council of the European Union , and they have been waiting for the instructions of the spoken , to create a new unilateral world order . 
the worst thing is that Mr Aznar and his colleagues an illegal war , have encouraged a humanitarian disaster in each of children , women and civilians were killed , mutilated or were injured and fear , hunger and disease . 
and the worst thing is that Mr Aznar has contravened the constitution , without the approval of the European Parliament or the consent of the King of Spain , and that he , together with its Getreuen contrary to the global opinion and the opinion of the weapons inspectors and without the support of the UN Security Council . this has acted law and the international institutions and a powerful blow to the Stärksten victims of the world , the violence and open the way the reason and justice , second and third pillars . 
in conclusion , I should like to say , thanks to them that we have once again that the world governed by the law of the jungle and that the third pillar of the European Union to . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mr Philippe Morillon , on his excellent report . 
this debate and the fact , as a few amendments it relatively , has shown that it has understood , in this very important issue a very broad consensus in this House . 
if we do with the situation before five years , compare in similar debates we see that , today , there is a very broad consensus on the need for a European Verteidigungsbeitrags in this House . 
for my congratulations to Philippe Morillon . 
his report is an important building block in the development of a Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
why is it necessary ? 
we have in September of last year , the new Sicherheitsstrategie taken note of the United States . 
we are at the moment , such as this week after week , the United States Sicherheitsstrategie systematically put into practice . 
what we as Europeans , there is a need for a European answer Sicherheitsstrategie . 
it is essential that we as Europeans as building block a common foreign policy first of all our interests jointly . 
I believe that this is possible . 
firstly , there is a broad consensus that we , as the European Union to capable of us in the framework of NATO , together with our allies , if necessary , but also against autonomously to defend any possible Angreifer . 
I would very much welcome it if the convention , were to a mutual Beistandsklausel for the new constitution of the European Union . 
secondly , we should develop the capabilities . this means that we need a little time , the geographical context of the European Union necessary contributions to the management of crises , and it is true that zivil and militarily . 
this is not yet been the case , we can do not yet autonomous , but this is a capacity that we need to develop . 
thirdly , we should be the European Union to be in a position at and around the world , Rettungsoperationen when it comes to the safety of European citizens . 
these are three further building blocks for an Sicherheitsstrategie of the European Union . 
if we do , we must develop in the experience which we take account of in similar major projects have made , as well as for the internal market or in the European currency . 
this has been a success because , only reason we clear content and long-term targets , what matters when we wanted to be in a position . 
there are some answers to this question in the report by Philippe Morillon . 
what the citizens of the European Union , is peace , security and stability . 
as a European Parliament , we must make our contribution that the European Union as a whole this claim indeed . 
Madam President , in connection with Iraq schwankte my mood between anger , Bedrückung and determination . 
the vote in favour of furiously arrogance and the Selbstüberschätzung of the United Kingdom and the United States , as the war . 
I am saddened that the European Union in its efforts to prevent this war , and a peaceful disarming the Iraqis to so powerless . 
but I am also determined to ensure , if I can , with my own small way that we have a rather united , coherent , uniform , common European foreign and defence policy . 
I am convinced that a rather united European Union would have been able to prevent this war , and also to disarm Saddam Hussein , a significant contribution to the production of peace between Israelis and Palestinians . 
this is a possibility there is still , and we should do everything within our power in order to overcome our relatively passing differences in many cases to national self-interest , and in this way , to a common position for Europe . 
we in the world an important role to play , and we should also now try to meet this role . 
in view of the most serious Sicherheitskrise after the end of the cold war , we have not been able , as a Union seriously and effectively against this crisis . 
this is very shocking . 
it would be töricht to adopt the war against Iraq would be in a one-off plan for war . 
it is obvious that Syria , Iran and also , of course , Cuba and North Korea also on the list . 
the European Union must at last , the situation in the and make it clear that we have the kind of action against Iraq have begun , and that together we do not support the serious and peaceful mechanisms of conflict prevention , to set up in order to achieve what the world needs , namely stability and peace . 
the today in the vanguard of Europe are only prepared the politicians , to speak with one voice when it comes to their own ideas . 
the common foreign and security policy is obviously not important enough for , in order to make concessions . 
as long as the foreign policy in the European Union to renationalised , will be a common defence as a steuerloses Kampfflugzeug , which is pilots are , in the air . 
both the excessive British talks about loyalty to Washington and the permanent French anti-Americanism are not the right guide for the European policy . 
it is to prevent an enlarged Union in a pro- and a antiamerikanisches camp from splintering . 
good transatlantic relations are in favour of Europe , for the United States , as well as for the rest of the world of fundamental importance . 
if the United States aufoktroyieren their pax Americana , are the today &apos; s political leaders of Europe with fault . 
as long as they say , in the severely what it is right , and Europe as a whole too little in the defence , we are condemned to a Nebenrolle to play in the world . 
the European Union must at least on our own continent , preferably be military action within the framework of NATO , but if necessary , also act . 
the involvement and strengthening of the military resources will be the basis for a common and solid security policy . 
the development of a European strategic concept , in which the emphasis on the crisis , is a great objective , which should , however , only then can achieve , if the leaders of Europe exclusively to speak with one voice . 
otherwise they should prefer their mouths . 
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . 
as a member of the GUE-NGL-Fraktion many , of course , I share the concerns of the majority of my group , and , in particular , I am as it is the question : how can progress in the defence cultures , be achieved if not before , has been set common foreign policy ? 
I would like to add that I , too , currently , such as the Präventivkriege in Iraq , in principle reject and the differences of opinion of the countries of Europe , in this important issue regret . 

however , think and I would like to say that if we are the monopoly of the NATO , as you know , a dominated by the United States , not organisation and conflicts through a strong and effective European diplomacy to regulate , then we must build a Europe of defence . 
we need a sort of Europe with clear objectives and principles , with specific tasks , with adequate resources and equipment and a legitimate , democratically controlled decision-making process . 
in my opinion , must conflicts throughout the world diplomatic channels , especially in the context of the UN , to be regulated . 
but in order to have a sufficient diplomatic weight and , therefore , conflicts with diplomatic resources to be resolved , is a real capacity for implementation of military action , and many others , I think that Europe must not abandon it . 
in short , if Europe fate not in the hands of the United States , it must intends to create the necessary conditions at last , and that the Europe of defence . 
Madam President , rarely has a report is so in good time as the General Philippe Morillon , on the new European security and Verteidigungsarchitektur : priorities and weaknesses , unfortunately , more weaknesses . 
firstly , this report comes so that in good time before the until the end aufgehobenen debate on the common foreign and security policy in the convention , and secondly , it is a time when , in Europe , the more pressing the question of direction in which a security and Verteidigungsarchitektur to move , within NATO , or outside the NATO , as a partner of the United States in seeing transatlantic alliance or removed from the European Konkurrenzunternehmen in its infancy ? 
the foreign and security policy of the European Union as conflict prevention and strengthen international security is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the establishment of a common foreign policy , which is the prerequisite for the development of a European defence policy , even as a matter of course , is , in this House controversial , even if it at the latest , since the war in Kosovo is clear that the European Union must be able , peacekeeping and friedensschaffende tasks to carry out what they are already in Macedonia . 
in our attempts are minor Doppelgleisigkeiten , such as , for example , that the NATO its own rapid intervention force has created a Konkurrenzunternehmen to European rapid reaction force has been set up . 
I therefore believe that it is important that , in a Zusatzantrag , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group a permanent task force is asking for which , until 2009 in a Kosovo-ähnlichen conflict in the geographical area of Europe in cooperation with NATO , or even autonomous must be fully . 
this shows an open and try to be aware , the Richtungsstreit within the EU &apos; s first . 
Austria has , since the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam , make it clear that it is our solidarity in a European security policy . 
we welcome any step in a practicable direction , and therefore support the concept of General Morillon . 
Madam President , the serious international crises to throw a special light on the national differences between the EU Member States . 
although the Union &apos; s crisis management a central and successful role in the Balkans and in Afghanistan , we were not played in the situation , promptly and efficiently the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia . 
the Irakkrieg , the differences in the history , Geopolitik and the political priorities of the Member States are , in the fore . 
the internal political situation in the various Member States will be further encouraged the controversy . 
we need any special cynicism , if the objective of the common European security guarantees for a utopian dream . 
however , it is now clear that the NATO losing and Europe more responsibility for their security and defence policy . 
the anerkennenswerte report by General Morillon is , therefore , to a good time . 
perhaps the current weltpolitische crisis and the Bedrohungsszenarien are really to encourage the strengthening of the European voice and ability to act . 
we do not suffice , ambitious objectives . 
we must also determined and practical . 
that is why the European Convention should the Commission &apos; s role in the foreign policy . 
unfortunately , however , things seem to reverse , and the cooperation between the governments adopted . 
once again we are on the contradiction between word and deed . 
in the work of the convention is produced at the same time as a result of activity of certain Member States to Skizzierung a common defence policy . 
we can adopted by the realistic that within the Union in this area with varying pace , as in Schengen and the economic and monetary union . 
but it is important to ensure that no closed clubs , which not all have access . 
in addition , it would be good , foreign and security policy objectives of the various Member States . 
the Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou has submitted a proposal in this respect . 
in my opinion , this should be tackled . 
for example , if we from the Geopolitik their differences know , we will see the potential for cooperation . 
Madam President , &apos; Argos speiste it with the blood of the pettifoggery - this line from a poem Péguys on Homer the critics of the report , I would like to say , Mr Morillon , because of the report by General Morillon is not a myth which places but undoubtedly the most interesting and on sorgfältigsten prepared document on this issue which is the for many years . 

the reasons for this positive assessment in the ambitious objective and in which this proposed realistic way . 

it is already on the adequacy of the report on the present time been pointed out on its comprehensive nature , the previous speakers have stressed . 
I should like , for my part , his sense of perspective and highlight the excellent exposition of the need to be taken into consideration the Zusammenspiels institutional elements . 
furthermore , I would like to the very creative dealing with the concept of closer cooperation , realistic and pragmatic way to the defence cultures , will be applied in the context of a genuine Gemeinschaftsverteidigung . 
it is the Bauanleitung for a Europe of defence which , in this report to the current and future realities and , in particular to adapt to the challenge of terrorism . 
it is often said that the generals put their armies at last wars . 
I hope that does not take place in the future , new wars , but , as we know , there are many conflicts . 
a general is proposing that we are in favour of the current and future conflicts scenario . 
for that he deserves thanks . 
I do not know whether this terrible neo-colonial war of aggression against Iraq soon to an end , but I know with safety , that I the victory of American imperialists in a war which the whole of mankind has opposed to prevent the they not , however , not throw at all . 
a barrier against war by President Bush would be a common position of Europe , but the European Union was and is actually divided and , therefore , powerless and weak . 
the approach of the United States that Europe is in favour of it versagte , was not enough ; it would have a specific opposition from the EU as such to sell . 
never was the lack of a single and united voice as significant as in this tragic situation ; never was the absence of the presence of Europe with its own seat in the United Nations Security Council to so much . 
Europe can and must in the world only with its own , independent foreign and defence policy by weight , be only a separate and independent economic , political and military force , which are not in contrast to the United States , but of them is independent . 
and Europe should , above all , his definition and its commitment to peace solemnly reaffirm , with a simple and clear explanation of how we propose an amendment : &apos; Europe rejects war as a means for resolving international conflict from &apos; . 
Madam President , I can tell you that , in this fortunate citizens in a quarter of Baghdad , together with unbewaffneten a huge US-Soldaten by the Sockel Statue of Saddam Hussein . 
the British Conservatives have the quest for an independent European Security and Defence Policy , always as one of the unbesonnensten political objectives of the European Union . 
others have been in turn to the Irrglauben chose that it is the ESDP mainly to the European Member States , assume a more comprehensive contribution to the defence . 
if this would be the case , then it is a laudable objectives . 
in reality , however , will the transatlantic alliance further , it will not be extra troops and there is no real purpose , with the exception of a transfer of powers in defence and security of Nato-Hauptquartier - where European countries with our American allies in a negotiating table - to the European Union , in particular exclusion of the United States . 
as the presidency has once again this afternoon , there is the ESDP as a priority in the interests of European integration . 
the divisions , the within the context of NATO and elsewhere in the run-up to the Irak-Krieges , there were a conscious consequence of this policy . 
the ESDP is not just a threat to NATO , it is an extremely intergovernmental organisation . 
the report by my friend , General Morillon , indeed , the objective of expressly communitisation of the defence policy within the European Union . 
the reservations I have taken note of Commissioner Patten . 
the British Conservatives speaking against this report , as Gebrauchsanweisung for an EU armed force and an extensive extension of the Gemeinschaftsbefugnisse in the defence and security . it is proposed , the European Commission far-reaching powers for military operations to grant discharge , including the right of initiative in the area of crisis management . 
the Community budget is the general costs for military operations . in addition , it is a common Beschaffungs- and Produktionspolitik on the basis of &apos; of the military needs of the EU as such is &apos; , the establishment of a common Militärakademie of the EU , a clause for collective defence in the form of a Protocol to the EU Treaty , a common EU-Polizeieinheit and a common coast guard authority , and a permanent seat for the EU in the UN Security Council . 
after the British Prime Minister his experience with the Irakkrieg has done , I hope now that it recognises , such as töricht and harmful the establishment of structures , which is only to a deepening the gulf between the countries of Europe and the United States . 
I also hope that the United States , despite the wide American / British solidarity in the Irakkrise no longer Tony Blairs use for the ESDP simply accept this . 
it should know better and both the consolidation of a new Atlantic Alliance . 
the European Union attaches more importance to their political ambitions as the real security interests of the citizens of the Member States . 
Madam President , the Irak-Krise , the extremely important subject of the common foreign , defence and security policy of the European Union in the dramatic been brought into focus . 
the report , Mr Morillon , and the previous report Lalumière give Parliament &apos; s observations and the concerns . 
however , they illustrate the political Korrelationen . 
a positive example is the recent presence of the European Union in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia . 
however , it is the problem . 
observations , observations that proposals , but when decisions are made , it is only slowly to their implementation . 
I would like to ask you , as it is with the implementation of the Galileo-Programms ? 
as it is with the famous Petersberg-Truppe and the Petersberg tasks ? 
as it is with the Eurofighter ? 
as it is with the programme for the construction of the major Lufttransporters , despite the fact that the last two programmes not programmes of the European Union ? 
sometimes , I wonder , we have not culminate in water to Danaïden-Fass ? 
Europe is a peacekeeping force , it must , however , a power for safety and international cooperation . 
Europe must its own personality develop and as an equal partner and an ally to act . 
Europe must its decisions both at institutional and practical level . 
the initiative of Germany and the three other countries is , in principle , to be welcomed . 
we will see . 
often , we have here to the ancient Athens and the old Rome referred ; however , we have recently different vielfarbig gekleidete kings and leaders , seen from old , untergegangenen colonial Königreichen in goldverzierten car tour the capitals of certain European countries paradierten . 
I do not know whether any similarity between with certain European political leaders in a divided Europe is , in certain intervals in Camp David or the location of the new Rome their Empfehlungsschreiben . 
finally , I would like to propose , Commissioner , Minister , that will be examined whether it not perhaps , be it would be better only symbolic reasons , some of the important meeting political nature , in future , on the location of the European Union , for the sake of our equality , our potential and our outlook symbolic . 
Madam President , in my opinion , the strategic issues dealt with in this report is extremely important , but also one of the most urgent European priorities , which the Union in the context of a uniform and coherent foreign policy not only in the fight against terrorism , but also in the defence and security capable of action . 
I therefore support the report , Mr Morillon , and will support all the proposals to this policies and credibility and seriousness into : the increase in the national defence budgets in the context of this strategy ; a proportion of the EU &apos; s budget for the promotion of research and development ; one on the integration and the end of a duplication of effort and waste abzielende planning ; Ad-hoc-Kooperationen and closer cooperation , if some Member States from legitimate reasons to take part in this commitment , transparent and effective integration of the European defence in a renewed NATO , or in a Atlantisches alliance , the sanctity of reiterates once again . 
the next serious Irak-Krise must also those who have supported these targets are not before their Vogelstraußpolitik give up . 
it must be along the same time , a concrete and as for the monetary union . 
the convention , Madam President , the opinion of the majority of Europeans , together with Parliament on the return of effective Multilateralität and a handlungsfähigen Union . 
Madam President , after the report by General Morillon is the desire to militarisieren , the European Union , and this will also by those who are trying to peace to be paid for . 
as the report in line with the constitution of the EU has been prepared , it was possible to demand measures , which we know that they are already being implemented . 
in the Treaty should be included a separate Solidaritätsklausel , according to which the Member States are obliged to combat terrorist threats , amongst other things . 
it is the principle of the Präventivkriegs in the EU . 
the military vanguard of the EU Member States , given the opportunity to pursue a still weitergehendere cooperation : if the crisis management of the EU in the work of the Kampftruppen extended , it is an illegal act without any UN mandate and with contempt for the geographical borders . 
the most military countries may be a different guarantee of security in the form of a statement or a protocol in terms of Article 5 of the EC Treaty . 
that is good , Kriegsfragen power in the Council must decide unanimously . 
that is better than it will fall to the Commission to decide whether or not an attack has been carried out . 
I would ask you to remember that , in the EU countries , which do not want to be a part of Militärbündnis . 
Madam President , the report by Mr Morillon , the us that Europe , and a uniform line should increase its military capabilities , if it wants to be a credible player , this spannungs- and so at the moment , it is precisely the right time . 
the war in Iraq is such a dramatic event , we must not be surprised if it serious differences of opinion between the Member States , but are already my impression after the first signs of a Meinungsumschwungs visible and is already a great temptation , on the Siegerseite - the United States , to , as soon as the battle is over . 
the countries against war , I have already stated , a number of Brosamen abzubekommen and to the kind . 
however , as General Morillon - a French General , but also a great supporters of Europe - has said , we cannot , in the decision-making process if we do not share the burden supports . 
I hope that it has quickly one at the end of the political Wahnvorstellungen , I have just heard in this House and the United States according to Iraq to Syria , Cuba and what I know what countries are attacked . 
the differences between the Member States were not specify in the European public , the large majority against the American action was . 
fortunately , there was in Europe Heads of State and Government , which have been able to the public misstrauen and its own idea of the world peace : a peace , in this case , unfortunately , only by a war could be to make the necessary even more tragedies in the coming years . 
if the Union &apos; s own Verteidigungsfähigkeit - as the report Morillon , and its own foreign affairs , and it is a significant role in the world , and I only hope that they can then the right decisions . 
Madam President , two thousand years has said that the Römer Cicero that there are two ways of resolving differences exist - negotiation or violence . 
as in people , the latter for wild animals . 
Ciceros words are still in force . 
we want to solve conflicts as people by negotiations or wild animals by violence ? 
should the EU to active conflict prevention or more resources for the human being to develop before birth conflicts , i.e. additional funds to invest in the military area ? 
can the conflicts of today and tomorrow are really to be resolved by ? 
I do not think so . 
what can we from the current in Iraq &apos; s war and from the fragmentation of the EU in questions to the common foreign and security policy ? 
in my opinion , the European Union should step up their international activities , the United Nations and strengthen its capacity for conflict prevention and -lösung , instead of more energy and resources in a common military defence to invest in the final analysis , however , as Commissioner Patten said , national issues . 
the EU should make sure that the reconstruction of Iraq under the auspices of the UN . 
a warring party is not an even-handed and cannot , therefore , the responsibility for these reconstruction . 
my own country , Sweden is strongly for conflict prevention , peace and crisis management . 
I support Sweden still does not have a common defence or their joint financing . 
nor , we support the idea that certain countries in the common Verteidigungsarbeit could take the lead , or the introduction of a clause to the collective defence . 
the war is too serious a matter , in the hands of the military to , even in the my honourable colleagues General Morillon . 
the most important tasks are the defence of international law , the strengthening of the UN and its work and the establishment of a capacity in the Union to Erkennung , prevention and resolution of conflicts . 
this is where the European Union is a major contribution to peace . 
I did Cicero before 2 000 years that only wild animals to solve conflicts through violence . 
it is high time that the EU should have focused on conflicts , rather than they are going to solve . 
Madam President , I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Morillon on his report , the he has presented the right time for two reasons : firstly , the common defence policy is a subject which , in the European Union is being discussed , and the other , urgently by other Members have already said . 
at the present time , the Irakkrise a problem that affects us all . 
but although the problem is a common , has it within the European Union have different solutions , as the Union neither a common foreign policy on a common defence policy . 
perhaps we should remember that , in the years have introduced the founding fathers of Europe , the European defence community . 
but the attempt key brake . this report is a positive step , as well as the report presented by the President a few years . 
it is a long process , we have to work in Europe , in order to create a common defence policy , which is directed against anyone , but on the cooperation with our allies and also with the Alliance , on the other side of the Atlantic . 
this is not a against NATO policy ; a policy designed to the cooperation with NATO . 
just as we have managed , in the year 2002 to establish a single currency , which are not yet each country is involved , however , I am sure will change in the foreseeable future , we must create a common European security and defence policy , and in the knowledge that the money is going to cost , but also in the belief that the European Union on the necessary financial resources . 
the convention must take into account in the drafting of the Unionsvertrages . 
Madam President , since the collapse of the real Socialism and the break-up of the Soviet Union will be a when the distribution of new markets and the wealth of the former Socialist countries and the redistribution of the already vergebenen markets . 
therefore , there is a angespannter competition between the Member States of the European Union and with the United States . 
at the same time , the European Union a comprehensive attack on the achievements of workers . 
in order to achieve these objectives , the European defence and security policy , the report Morillon . 
obviously , there are actually finding excuses , conflict prevention , crisis management , etc . the truth is that a European army is created , with Söldnern by modern education and training are equipped with modern weapons , whose task is to the interests of big business , wherever it has set and wherever the NATO the orders to intervene , is to defend . 
it is , of course , as the report Morillon state , this is not about the relationship between the European Union and NATO and the United States is considering breaking off . 
on the contrary , there is talk of mutual strengthening and close cooperation with NATO , which is seen as a stroke bonds , the United States and the interests of Europe . 
it also means that this could be this way , because , among other things , the majority of the Member States of the European Union , the majority of the Member States of the NATO , however , is dominated by the United States and . 
this ties alone would be enough , about the real nature and the task of the famous ESDP to make this clear . 
the people , as we can be sure , no illusion . 
they have had bitter experiences with NATO and the policy of the European Union already witnessed in security and defence issues . 
the Proklamationen after the events of 11 September , &apos; we are all Americans &apos; , is still in its ears . 
the people saw recently , such as the Member States of the European Union in Prague the new aggressive NATO-Politik , signed , Präventivschläge . this is exactly what the American and British imperialists at the moment and what they do in Iraq , if the people of permit , will do elsewhere . 
as you know , in fact , that the proposals that an increase in the military spending by military hardware help to strengthen the European defence industry , a profitable future to ensure that it has , however , for their safety , the income of people and for the peace process does not bode well . 
it is a disgrace that these proposals have been presented by the Greek government and which , without shame , proud of the fact is that the war before the end of the Greek Presidency will be ready . 
this is not a defence and security policy , it is a policy of aggression and insecurity . and it is precisely for this reason , this policy in contrast to the vision of our peoples , the it . 
the crime in Iraq , it is now being committed , since we are talking about here , there is , after Yugoslavia and Afghanistan , once again , an idea of the objectives of these policies . 
the people are demanding a diametrically opposed policy , a policy of peace , the peaceful coexistence of the peoples , a policy which , without solving conflicts of violence and war to demonstrate , a policy of disarmament and peace . 
I am sure they will this policy , as well its opponents also stemmen against it . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the last Wortbeitrag and even some before that I am always have a aware , for example : where Kommunist , it is precisely what the people want ? 
others have said here , it is about the distribution of wealth socialism . 
I would like , our citizens would listen more these debates . 
a Social Democrat has , of the &quot; colonial centre Camp David . &quot; 
I wonder what we are of arguments in such a debate , and I wonder whether they even before the citizens of their country , to say . 
if you take , for example , the Kosovo . 
in Kosovo wanted the citizens , that the European Union ? . 
? . 
Mr Korakas , to the European citizens , that in the twenty-first century no further on the continent of Europe Massenvergewaltigungen and expulsions . 
that is why the European security and defence policy . 
we have seen in 1999 , as Europeans we would be in no position to act , if the Americans would not help us . 
this was the Helsinki Summit 1999 . we have come a long way with what we have developed in the institutions . 
the report , Mr Morillon , as expressed in the excellent way . on 1 April , we have a small mandate for the first time in Macedonia , also to the pacification in a situation in a country , and not military conflicts , such as the result of some raised here . 
I think that are good signals from Europe , the citizens expect from us . 
the time of our debate on this report is a very important . now it is important that both the two extreme parties , the German and the British Government , come back again in the European institutions and that they are once again trying to European solutions to find a way to make . 
we have all seen in this armed conflict in the world : we all do not apply . we cannot have a contribution to peace in the world , when we act against . 
we need European mechanisms . 
what is proposed in this report is a richtigerer step than the summit will shortly be discussed in Brussels . as meet only four Member States , but at the same again the suspicion that there is a rather a against other allies a political action . 
we also need Great Britain , with the table , because without Great Britain this step not succeed . 
Madam President , I should first like to congratulate Mr Morillon , on his report , in the normal balanced way imagination and realism , vision and pragmatism . 
I would him to see even Mr Korakas , then it will perhaps it would in fact , a different opinion . 
the real question we face is , of course , Kosovo has been said , the European Union to be Militärmacht ? 
I agree with the previous speaker , Mr Laschet right : we have in the last few weeks and months , as Europe , unfortunately , no weltpolitisch role . 
this is the fact . 
it is now in particular , will , of course , always says , as Commissioner Patten . 
we are actually willing , a role to play ? 
I believe - and the report Morillon , of course , be adopted by a large majority in this House : we wish to have a reasonable weltpolitische role to play . 
we can military underpin ? 
I believe that a military underpin can help us if there is a common foreign and security policy . 
they can the common foreign and security policy , but not replace can support and help them very well . 
now , I am sceptical about a arms race . 
in fact , it would be absurd to say , we have previously wettgerüstet , because there is a opponents , with which we have a strong . we must now arms race , because there is a partners , namely the United States of America , with which we must gleichrüsten . 
but - and we are right here - read the report Morillon says , primarily , not solely , but primarily , it is a question of our defence expenditure so as to coordinate and coordinate that we firstly with the same amount of a much greater effect , greater efficiency . 
secondly , it is no doubt also due to see where are the gaps as Europeans we can finish . 
in fact , there are two alternative models : that it is , as it is , for me is no alternative . 
the alternative is that we as the United States will be a Militärmacht , just a little less , a little less imperialistisch , a little less effective . 
in my view , this is not acceptable . 
the other alternative is that we are working for a common foreign and security policy a military justification , as expressed in his report , Mr Morillon , so that we are capable and efficiently , in the context of a multilateral policy to act . 
these are we not at present . 
the report by Mr Morillon , on how we could act in a multilateral framework efficiently . 
we therefore support the report , Mr Morillon loud and clear . 
Madam President , General Morillon has an interesting and sound report which , in some parts of it will affect the convention . 
the European defence industry is the key to the development of a common European defence policy , which form part of the transatlantic cooperation . 
we must , therefore , a strong European defence industry , based on is and common competition , and . 
we should try to abolish any trade protectionism , also in the area of the arms trade , and the United States of completely opening up of their Waffenmarktes . 
the present system is ineffective and expensive . 
the taxpayers have the right to demand that each and every euro , which is used effectively , we think European . 
a European Rüstungsagentur is therefore absolutely necessary . 
the European taxpayer really believe that it out rationally and efficiently , that the development of three ultramodernen to finance Kampfflugzeugen ? 
the European defence industry COs run the risk of sites of Hochtechnologieforschung Montageanlagen to nothing . 
this would make Europe less and dependent . 
however , I cannot under any circumstances , we believe that , more without the United Kingdom . 
we should look at the constructive part and on common definitions and methods . 
only with a larger budget for supplying arms and a on research and European defence industry within the framework of a common defence policy a credible , effective and reliable partner of the United States . 
Madam President , I would like to my honourable friend General Morillon on his report . 
as my previous speakers have already said , it will have the right time . 
I am a strong supporter of the creation of a EU-Verteidigungspolitik , because I believe that this for a fundamental part of the European integration as the single currency . 
if , in addition , we learn from the debacle want to draw the and , in which the European Union is at the moment , then the European Convention and the following Intergovernmental Conference in the heart of this report to take account of arguments . 
I am a clear supporters of the transatlantic alliance between the EU and the United States , but not in its present form , if we are simply is expected to rubber-stamp the foreign policy objectives of the United States , even if we do not agree with them . 
it must be a new balance on the basis of a real partnership will be created , in which the two sides of the drawing up the agreed political objectives . 
however , we must understand that we have any influence on the United States , if we are in such a dependence on them . 
as General Morillon said , we must also share the burden . 
in addition , is that a EU-Verteidigungspolitik on a single common foreign and security policy is based . 
I am not believe that our current differences of opinion on the occasion of our divided response to the crisis in Iraq give rise to the pessimism and Lähmungserscheinungen . 
if anything , it should be , from the political obligation to ensure that this will never again in the future . 
if we really our influence on the world stage , then we should want to make the EU-Staats- and Government to agree to the offices of the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations , zusammenzulegen , a single management by an adequate funding to set up and all our instruments in strategic sector - including trade , development , the environment , Justice and Home Affairs , on the use , in order to clear political objectives in the heart of our foreign policy . 
it is to be hoped that we in our way of creating structures not the importance of conflict prevention and continuous investment in our Demokratisierungs- and human rights strategy ignore , because violations in these areas , in many parts of the world will lead to conflicts . 
Madam President , I would also like to support the excellent report by Mr Morillon , the Atlantiker and Euro-Gaullisten integrated plunge into constructing grand way . 
as someone who is a great deal of euro-gaullistischer as Mr Morillon , I would like to konzedieren that it is excellent , these two elements of European foreign and security policy to combine . 
we can the issue of the European defence not discuss such as the question of whether we need a European Marmeladen-Richtlinie or not . 
it is merely the very raison d &apos;être of the gathering European agreement . 
I do not see it , see that many of our citizens . this is shown by the surveys . 
the meaning of the European unification is peace and security , both internally and peace and security externally . 
that is why it is high time that we make progress in the European foreign and security policy , and I am not as pessimistic as many other colleagues . 
it is true that our governments have a jämmerliches picture . 
but if you look at the peoples of public opinion , there is between the peoples in the great basic issues - also in the Irak-Krieg - a much greater agreement as between the governments . 
I believe that we need instruments and institutions , the common will of the people , not only &apos; , but also an active policy and , because it is not only the respective atmosphere behind . 
we need a good , long-term strategy as the basis of a common foreign and security policy . 
I believe that the convention is the last opportunity , in the major Community of 15 - and soon the 25 or 30 - of a common foreign and security policy . 
I hope that it is able to do so . 
I am not Kern-Europa . 
I do not want to fragmentation of Europe . 
but if it in this wider circle not manage to make progress , then we need to develop into a Kern-Europa . 
however , to a Kern-Europa , which is open to all those who are prepared to a common foreign and security policy . 
I would like to a more say quite clearly : I believe that we need both alliance . 
but even Franz-Josef Strauß , the late chairman of my party , said : &apos; that both alliance will only have a future , if it permanently on two at the same strong pillars is built on an American pillar and on a European pillar . &apos; 
and that this European pillar does not exist , is not the fault of the Americans . 
it is our fault as Europeans .
