\title{A Short Report of My Solution to the Assignment}

\author{Wei Qiu}

\maketitle

\section{Directory structure}
I reorganized the files to make my solution easier to explain.
\begin{itemize}
    \item All the data is located at data.
    \item Test data is in data/test. And test.en is copied to reference0.
    \item Train data is in data/train. 
    \item Dev data is in data/dev.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem 1 \& 3}

A baseline system is not so interesting.
I address subproblem 1 and 3 together, i.e, I get a fine-tuned system using the development set. 
The config file is located at baseline/config.

\section{Problem 2}
The first idea comes to my mind is to simply append all of the terminology table to the training table. The sript split\_term.py is used to split the terminology into seperate files. Then I manually append them to the corresponding training files.

The trained model using this idea is located at prob2. The corresponding training data is at data/train\_term.

A further research shows that moses has an advanced feature that can let the user specify how to translate certain words by marking up them during preprocessing.\footnote{\url{http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.AdvancedFeatures#ntoc11}}
This may be the best approach to deal with external terminology dictionary.




\section{Problem 5: further improvement}
There are at least two ways to improve the translation quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As German is an agglutinative language, splitting up the compound words can reduce the sparsity. 
    \item As the word order in German has much more freedom than English, a preprocessing step which always normalize German sentence to SVO can reduce the sparisity as well.
\end{itemize}
